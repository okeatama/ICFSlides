'Have you been eating from the tree I forbade you to eat?'", "12": " The man replied, 'It was the woman you put with me; she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.'", "13": " Then Yahweh God said to the woman, 'Why did you do that?'

Painfully will you get your food from it as long as you live.", "18": " It will yield you brambles and thistles, as you eat the produce of the land.", "19": " By the sweat of your face will you earn your food, until you return to the ground, as you were taken from it. For dust you are and to dust you shall return.'", "20": " The man named his wife 'Eve' because she was the mother of all those who live.", "21": " Yahweh God made tunics of skins for the man and his wife and clothed them.", "22": " Then Yahweh God said, 'Now that the man has become like one of us in knowing good from evil, he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and pick from the tree of life too, and eat and live for ever!'", "23": " So Yahweh God expelled him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil from which he had been taken.", "24": " He banished the man, and in front of the garden of Eden he posted the great winged creatures and the fiery flashing sword, to guard the way to the tree of life."},

I shall tell him, \"My brothers and my father's family who were in Canaan have come to me.", "32": " The men are shepherds and look after livestock, and they have brought their flocks and cattle and all their possessions.\"", "33": " Thus, when Pharaoh summons you and asks, \"What is your occupation?\",", "34": " you are to say, \"Ever since our boyhood your servants have looked after livestock, we and our fathers before us,\" so that you can stay in the Goshen region -- for the Egyptians have a horror of all shepherds.'"},
{"1": " So Joseph went and told Pharaoh, 'My father and brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks and cattle and all their possessions. Here they are, in the region of Goshen.'", "2": " He had taken five of his brothers, and he now presented them to Pharaoh.", "3": " Pharaoh asked his brothers, 'What is your occupation?' and they gave Pharaoh the answer, 'Your servants are shepherds, like our fathers before us.'", "4": " They went on to tell Pharaoh, 'We have come to stay in this country for the time being, since there is no pasturage for your servants' flocks, Canaan being stricken with famine. So now please allow your servants to settle in the region of Goshen.'", "5": " Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,'They may stay in the region of Goshen, and if you know of any capable men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.' Jacob and his sons went to Egypt where Joseph was. Pharaoh king of Egypt heard about this and said to Joseph, 'Your father and brothers have come to you. The country of Egypt is open to you: settle your father and brothers in the best region.'", "6": " The country of Egypt is open to you: settle your father and brothers in the best region.'", "7": " Joseph brought his father and presented him to Pharaoh. Jacob paid his respects to Pharaoh.", "8": " Pharaoh asked Jacob, 'How many years have you lived?'", "9": " Jacob said to Pharaoh, 'The years of my stay on earth add up to one hundred and thirty years. Few and unhappy my years have been, falling short of my ancestors' years in their stay on earth.'", "10": " Jacob then took leave of Pharaoh and withdrew from his presence.", "11": " Joseph then settled his father and brothers, giving them land holdings in Egypt, in the best part of the country, the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh had ordered.", "12": " Joseph provided his father, brothers and all his father's family with food, down to the least of them.", "13": " And on all the earth around there was now no food anywhere, for the famine had grown very severe, and Egypt and Canaan were both weak with hunger.", "14": " Joseph accumulated all the money to be found in Egypt and Canaan, in exchange for the supplies being handed out, and put the money in Pharaoh's palace.", "15": " When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was exhausted, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, pleading, 'Give us food, unless you want us to die before your eyes! For our money has come to an end.'", "16": " Joseph replied, 'Hand over your livestock and I shall issue you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money has come to an end.'", "17": " So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for horses and livestock, whether sheep or cattle, and for donkeys. Thus he saw them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.", "18": " When that year was over, they came to him the next year, and said to him, 'We cannot hide it from my lord: the truth is, our money has run out and the livestock is in my lord's possession. There is nothing left for my lord except our bodies and our land.", "19": " If we and our land are not to perish, take us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will become Pharaoh's serfs; only give us seed, so that we can survive and not die and the land not revert to desert!'", "20": " Thus Joseph acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, since one by one the Egyptians sold their fields, so hard pressed were they by the famine; and the whole country passed into Pharaoh's possession,", "21": " while the people he reduced to serfdom from one end of Egypt to the other.", "22": " The only land he did not acquire belonged to the priests, for the priests received an allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them. Hence they had no need to sell their land.", "23": " Then Joseph said to the people, 'This is how we stand: I have bought you out, with your land, on Pharaoh's behalf. Here is seed for you to sow the land.", "24": " But of the harvest you must give a fifth to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you can have for sowing your fields, to provide food for yourselves and your households, and food for your children.'", "25": " 'You have saved our lives!' they replied. 'If it please my lord, we will become serfs to Pharaoh.'", "26": " So Joseph made a law, still in force today, as regards the soil of Egypt, that one-fifth should go to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not go to Pharaoh.", "27": " Thus Israel settled in Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there; they were fruitful and grew very numerous.", "28": " Jacob lived seventeen years in Egypt; thus Jacob's total age came to a hundred and forty-seven years.", "29": " When Israel's time to die drew near he sent for his son Joseph and said to him, 'If you really love me, place your hand under my thigh as pledge that you will act with faithful love towards me: do not bury me in Egypt!", "30": " When I lie down with my ancestors, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their tomb.' 'I shall do as you say,' he replied.", "31": " 'Swear to me,' he insisted. So he swore to him, and Israel sank back on the pillow."},
{"1": " Some time later, Joseph was informed, 'Your father has been taken ill.' So he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim.", "2": " When Jacob was told, 'Look, your son Joseph has come to you,' Israel, summoning his strength, sat up in bed.", "3": " 'El Shaddai appeared to me at Luz in Canaan,' Jacob told Joseph, 'and he blessed me,", "4": " saying to me, \"I shall make you fruitful and numerous, and shall make you into an assembly of peoples and give this country to your descendants after you, to own in perpetuity.\"", "5": " Now your two sons, born to you in Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be as much mine as Reuben and Simeon.", "6": " But with regard to the children you have had since them, they shall be yours, and they shall be known by their brothers' names for the purpose of their inheritance.", "7": " 'When I was on my way from Paddan, to my sorrow death took your mother Rachel from me in Canaan, on the journey while only a short distance from Ephrath. I buried her there on the road to Ephrath -- now Bethlehem.'", "8": " When Israel saw Joseph's two sons, he asked, 'Who are these?'", "9": " 'They are my sons, whom God has given me here,' Joseph told his father. 'Then bring them to me', he said, 'so that I may bless them.'", "10": " Now, Israel's eyes were dim with age, and he could not see. So Joseph made them come closer to him and he kissed and embraced them.", "11": " Then Israel said to Joseph, 'I did not think I should ever see you again, and now God has let me see your children as well!'", "12": " Then Joseph took them from his lap and bowed to the ground.", "13": " Then Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim with his right hand so that he should be on Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand, so that he should be on Israel's right, and brought them close to him.", "14": " But Israel held out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and his left on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands -- Manasseh was, in fact, the elder.", "15": " Then he blessed Joseph saying: May the God in whose presence my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd from my birth until this day,", "16": " the Angel who has saved me from all harm, bless these boys, so that my name may live on in them, and the names of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac, and they grow into teeming multitudes on earth!", "17": " Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and this he thought was wrong, so he took his father's hand and tried to shift it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh.", "18": " Joseph protested to his father, 'Not like that, father! This one is the elder; put your right hand on his head.'", "19": " But his father refused. 'I know, my son, I know,' he said. 'He too shall become a people; he too will be great. But his younger brother will be greater, his offspring will be sufficient to constitute nations.'", "20": " So he blessed them that day, saying: By you shall Israel bless itself, saying, 'God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!' putting Ephraim before Manasseh.", "21": " Then Israel said to Joseph, 'Now I am about to die. But God will be with you and take you back to the land of your ancestors.", "22": " As for me, I give you a Shechem more than your brothers, the one I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.'"},
{"1": " Jacob called his sons and said, 'Gather round, so that I can tell you what is in store for you in the final days.", "2": " Gather round, sons of Jacob, and listen; listen to Israel your father.", "3": " Reuben, you are my first-born, my vigour, and the first-fruit of my manhood, foremost in pride, foremost in strength,", "4": " uncontrolled as water: you will not be foremost, for you climbed into your father's bed, and so defiled my couch, to my sorrow.", "5": " Simeon and Levi are brothers in carrying out their malicious plans.", "6": " May my soul not enter their council nor my heart join their company, for in their rage they have killed men and hamstrung oxen at their whim.", "7": " Accursed be their rage for its ruthlessness, their wrath for its ferocity. I shall disperse them in Jacob, I shall scatter them through Israel.", "8": " Judah, your brothers will praise you: you grip your enemies by the neck, your father's sons will do you homage.", "9": " Judah is a lion's whelp; You stand over your prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, a mighty lion: who dare rouse him?", "10": " The sceptre shall not pass from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute be brought him and the peoples render him obedience.", "11": " He tethers his donkey to the vine, to its stock the foal of his she-donkey. He washes his clothes in wine, his robes in the blood of the grape.", "12": " His eyes are darkened with wine and his teeth are white with milk.", "13": " Zebulun will live by the seashore and be a sailor on board the ships, with Sidon on his flank.", "14": " Issachar is a strong donkey lying down among sheepfolds.", "15": " When he saw how good the resting-place and how pleasant the country, he bowed his shoulder to the load and became a slave to forced labour.", "16": " Dan will govern his people like any other of the tribes of Israel.", "17": " May Dan be a snake on the road, a viper on the path, who bites the horse on the hock so that its rider falls off backwards!", "18": " I long for your deliverance, Yahweh!", "19": " Gad will be raided by raiders, and he will raid at their heels.", "20": " Rich the food produced by Asher: he will furnish food fit for kings.", "21": " Naphtali is a swift hind bearing lovely fawns.", "22": " Joseph is a fruitful plant near a spring whose tendrils reach over the wall.", "23": " Archers in their hostility drew their bows and attacked him.", "24": " But their bows were broken by a mighty One, the sinews of their arms were snapped by the power of the Mighty One of Jacob, by the Name of the Stone of Israel,", "25": " the God of your father who assists you, El Shaddai who blesses you: blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep lying below, blessings of the breasts and womb,", "26": " blessings of the grain and flowers, blessings of the eternal mountains, bounty of the everlasting hills -- may they descend on Joseph's head, on the crown of the one dedicated from among his brothers!", "27": " Benjamin is a ravening wolf, in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he is still sharing out the spoil.'", "28": " All these make up the tribes of Israel, twelve in number, and this is what their father said to them as he bade them farewell, giving each an appropriate blessing.", "29": " Then he gave them these instructions, 'I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my ancestors, in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,", "30": " in the cave in the field at Machpelah, facing Mamre, in Canaan, which Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site of his own.", "31": " There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried. There Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried; and there I buried Leah-", "32": " the field and the cave in it which were bought from the Hittites.'", "33": " When Jacob had finished giving his instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, and breathing his last was gathered to his people."},
{"1": " At this Joseph threw himself on his father's face, covering it with tears and kisses.", "2": " Then Joseph ordered the doctors in his service to embalm his father. The doctors embalmed Israel,", "3": " and it took them forty days, for embalming takes forty days to complete. The Egyptians mourned him for seventy days.", "4": " When the period of mourning for him was over, Joseph said to Pharaoh's household, 'If you have any affection for me, see that this message reaches Pharaoh's ears,", "5": " \"My father put me under oath, saying: I am about to die.

So may I have leave to go up and bury my father, and then come back?\" '", "6": " Pharaoh replied, 'Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.'", "7": " Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went all Pharaoh's officials, the dignitaries of his palace and all the dignitaries of Egypt,", "8": " as well as all Joseph's family, his brothers and his father's family.
