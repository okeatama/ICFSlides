'Prowling about on earth,' he answered, 'roaming around there.'", "8": " So Yahweh asked him, 'Did you pay any attention to my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth: a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil.'", "9": " 'Yes,' Satan said, 'but Job is not God-fearing for nothing, is he?", "10": " Have you not put a wall round him and his house and all his domain? You have blessed all he undertakes, and his flocks throng the countryside.", "11": " But stretch out your hand and lay a finger on his possessions: then, I warrant you, he will curse you to your face.'", "12": " 'Very well,' Yahweh said to Satan, 'all he has is in your power. But keep your hands off his person.' So Satan left the presence of Yahweh.", "13": " On the day when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking in their eldest brother's house,", "14": " a messenger came to Job. 'Your oxen', he said, 'were at the plough, with the donkeys grazing at their side,", "15": " when the Sabaeans swept down on them and carried them off, and put the servants to the sword: I alone have escaped to tell you.'", "16": " He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. 'The fire of God', he said, 'has fallen from heaven and burnt the sheep and shepherds to ashes: I alone have escaped to tell you.'", "17": " He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. 'The Chaldaeans,' he said, 'three bands of them, have raided the camels and made off with them, and put the servants to the sword: I alone have escaped to tell you.'", "18": " He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. 'Your sons and daughters', he said, 'were eating and drinking at their eldest brother's house,", "19": " when suddenly from the desert a gale sprang up, and it battered all four corners of the house which fell in on the young people. They are dead: I alone have escaped to tell you.'", "20": " Then Job stood up, tore his robe and shaved his head. Then, falling to the ground, he prostrated himself", "21": " and said: Naked I came from my mother's womb, naked I shall return again. Yahweh gave, Yahweh has taken back. Blessed be the name of Yahweh!", "22": " In all this misfortune Job committed no sin, and he did not reproach God."},

There is no one like him on the earth: a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil. He persists in his integrity still; you achieved nothing by provoking me to ruin him.'", "4": " 'Skin after skin!' Satan replied. 'Someone will give away all he has to save his life.", "5": " But stretch out your hand and lay a finger on his bone and flesh; I warrant you, he will curse you to your face.'", "6": " 'Very well,' Yahweh said to Satan, 'he is in your power. But spare his life.'", "7": " So Satan left the presence of Yahweh. He struck Job down with malignant ulcers from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.", "8": " Job took a piece of pot to scrape himself, and went and sat among the ashes.", "9": " Then his wife said to him, 'Why persist in this integrity of yours? Curse God and die.'", "10": " 'That is how a fool of a woman talks,' Job replied. 'If we take happiness from God's hand, must we not take sorrow too?' And in all this misfortune Job uttered no sinful word.", "11": " The news of all the disasters that had fallen on Job came to the ears of three of his friends. Each of them set out from home -- Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah and Zophar of Naamath -- and by common consent they decided to go and offer him sympathy and consolation.", "12": " Looking at him from a distance, they could not recognise him; they wept aloud and tore their robes and threw dust over their heads.", "13": " They sat there on the ground beside him for seven days and seven nights. To Job they spoke never a word, for they saw how much he was suffering."},
