And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.", "28": " After this, Jesus knew that everything had now been completed and, so that the scripture should be completely fulfilled, he said: I am thirsty.", "29": " A jar full of sour wine stood there; so, putting a sponge soaked in the wine on a hyssop stick, they held it up to his mouth.", "30": " After Jesus had taken the wine he said, 'It is fulfilled'; and bowing his head he gave up his spirit.", "31": " It was the Day of Preparation, and to avoid the bodies' remaining on the cross during the Sabbath -- since that Sabbath was a day of special solemnity -- the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away.", "32": " Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with him and then of the other.", "33": " When they came to Jesus, they saw he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs", "34": " one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water.", "35": " This is the evidence of one who saw it -- true evidence, and he knows that what he says is true -- and he gives it so that you may believe as well.", "36": " Because all this happened to fulfil the words of scripture: Not one bone of his will be broken;", "37": " and again, in another place scripture says: They will look to the one whom they have pierced.", "38": " After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus -- though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews -- asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and took it away.", "39": " Nicodemus came as well -- the same one who had first come to Jesus at night-time -- and he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.", "40": " They took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, following the Jewish burial custom.", "41": " At the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in this garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.", "42": " Since it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."},
{"1": " It was very early on the first day of the week and still dark, when Mary of Magdala came to the tomb. She saw that the stone had been moved away from the tomb", "2": " and came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. 'They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,' she said, 'and we don't know where they have put him.'", "3": " So Peter set out with the other disciple to go to the tomb.", "4": " They ran together, but the other disciple, running faster than Peter, reached the tomb first;", "5": " he bent down and saw the linen cloths lying on the ground, but did not go in.", "6": " Simon Peter, following him, also came up, went into the tomb, saw the linen cloths lying on the ground", "7": " and also the cloth that had been over his head; this was not with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself.", "8": " Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and he believed.", "9": " Till this moment they had still not understood the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.", "10": " The disciples then went back home.", "11": " But Mary was standing outside near the tomb, weeping. Then, as she wept, she stooped to look inside,", "12": " and saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head, the other at the feet.", "13": " They said, 'Woman, why are you weeping?' 'They have taken my Lord away,' she replied, 'and I don't know where they have put him.'", "14": " As she said this she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, though she did not realise that it was Jesus.", "15": " Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?' Supposing him to be the gardener, she said, 'Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and remove him.'", "16": " Jesus said, 'Mary!' She turned round then and said to him in Hebrew, 'Rabbuni!' -- which means Master.", "17": " Jesus said to her, 'Do not cling to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to the brothers, and tell them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'", "18": " So Mary of Magdala told the disciples, 'I have seen the Lord,' and that he had said these things to her.", "19": " In the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, the doors were closed in the room where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them, 'Peace be with you,'", "20": " and, after saying this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Lord,", "21": " and he said to them again, 'Peace be with you. 'As the Father sent me, so am I sending you.'", "22": " After saying this he breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit.", "23": " If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone's sins, they are retained.", "24": " Thomas, called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.", "25": " So the other disciples said to him, 'We have seen the Lord,' but he answered, 'Unless I can see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe.'", "26": " Eight days later the disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came in and stood among them. 'Peace be with you,' he said.", "27": " Then he spoke to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving any more but believe.'", "28": " Thomas replied, 'My Lord and my God!'", "29": " Jesus said to him: You believe because you can see me. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.", "30": " There were many other signs that Jesus worked in the sight of the disciples, but they are not recorded in this book.", "31": " These are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing this you may have life through his name."},
{"1": " Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples. It was by the Sea of Tiberias, and it happened like this:", "2": " Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two more of his disciples were together.", "3": " Simon Peter said, 'I'm going fishing.' They replied, 'We'll come with you.' They went out and got into the boat but caught nothing that night.", "4": " When it was already light, there stood Jesus on the shore, though the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus.", "5": " Jesus called out, 'Haven't you caught anything, friends?' And when they answered, 'No,'", "6": " he said, 'Throw the net out to starboard and you'll find something.' So they threw the net out and could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.", "7": " The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It is the Lord.' At these words, 'It is the Lord,' Simon Peter tied his outer garment round him (for he had nothing on) and jumped into the water.", "8": " The other disciples came on in the boat, towing the net with the fish; they were only about a hundred yards from land.", "9": " As soon as they came ashore they saw that there was some bread there and a charcoal fire with fish cooking on it.", "10": " Jesus said, 'Bring some of the fish you have just caught.'", "11": " Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of big fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them; and in spite of there being so many the net was not broken.", "12": " Jesus said to them, 'Come and have breakfast.' None of the disciples was bold enough to ask, 'Who are you?'. They knew quite well it was the Lord.", "13": " Jesus then stepped forward, took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish.", "14": " This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead.", "15": " When they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you love me more than these others do?' He answered, 'Yes, Lord, you know I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'", "16": " A second time he said to him, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' He replied, 'Yes, Lord, you know I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Look after my sheep.'", "17": " Then he said to him a third time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' Peter was hurt that he asked him a third time, 'Do you love me?' and said, 'Lord, you know everything; you know I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep.", "18": " In all truth I tell you, when you were young you put on your own belt and walked where you liked; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands, and somebody else will put a belt round you and take you where you would rather not go.'", "19": " In these words he indicated the kind of death by which Peter would give glory to God. After this he said, 'Follow me.'", "20": " Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them -- the one who had leant back close to his chest at the supper and had said to him, 'Lord, who is it that will betray you?'", "21": " Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, 'What about him, Lord?'", "22": " Jesus answered, 'If I want him to stay behind till I come, what does it matter to you? You are to follow me.'", "23": " The rumour then went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus had not said to Peter, 'He will not die,' but, 'If I want him to stay behind till I come.'", "24": " This disciple is the one who vouches for these things and has written them down, and we know that his testimony is true.", "25": " There was much else that Jesus did; if it were written down in detail, I do not suppose the world itself would hold all the books that would be written."},
{"1": " After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.", "2": " Now in Jerusalem next to the Sheep Pool there is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five porticos;", "3": " and under these were crowds of sick people, blind, lame, paralysed.", "4": " for at intervals the angel of the Lord came down into the pool, and the water was disturbed, and the first person to enter the water after this disturbance was cured of any ailment he suffered from.", "5": " One man there had an illness which had lasted thirty-eight years,", "6": " and when Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in that condition for a long time, he said, 'Do you want to be well again?'", "7": " 'Sir,' replied the sick man, 'I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; and while I am still on the way, someone else gets down there before me.'", "8": " Jesus said, 'Get up, pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around.'", "9": " The man was cured at once, and he picked up his mat and started to walk around. Now that day happened to be the Sabbath,", "10": " so the Jews said to the man who had been cured, 'It is the Sabbath; you are not allowed to carry your sleeping-mat.'", "11": " He replied, 'But the man who cured me told me, \"Pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around.\" '", "12": " They asked, 'Who is the man who said to you, \"Pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around\"? '", "13": " The man had no idea who it was, since Jesus had disappeared, as the place was crowded.", "14": " After a while Jesus met him in the Temple and said, 'Now you are well again, do not sin any more, or something worse may happen to you.'", "15": " The man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.", "16": " It was because he did things like this on the Sabbath that the Jews began to harass Jesus.", "17": " His answer to them was, 'My Father still goes on working, and I am at work, too.'", "18": " But that only made the Jews even more intent on killing him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he spoke of God as his own Father and so made himself God's equal.", "19": " To this Jesus replied: In all truth I tell you, by himself the Son can do nothing; he can do only what he sees the Father doing: and whatever the Father does the Son does too.", "20": " For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he himself does, and he will show him even greater things than these, works that will astonish you.", "21": " Thus, as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to anyone he chooses;", "22": " for the Father judges no one; he has entrusted all judgement to the Son,", "23": " so that all may honour the Son as they honour the Father. Whoever refuses honour to the Son refuses honour to the Father who sent him.", "24": " In all truth I tell you, whoever listens to my words, and believes in the one who sent me, has eternal life; without being brought to judgement such a person has passed from death to life.", "25": " In all truth I tell you, the hour is coming -- indeed it is already here -- when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and all who hear it will live.", "26": " For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself;", "27": " and, because he is the Son of man, has granted him power to give judgement.", "28": " Do not be surprised at this, for the hour is coming when the dead will leave their graves at the sound of his voice:", "29": " those who did good will come forth to life; and those who did evil will come forth to judgement.", "30": " By myself I can do nothing; I can judge only as I am told to judge, and my judging is just, because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me.", "31": " Were I to testify on my own behalf, my testimony would not be true;", "32": " but there is another witness who speaks on my behalf, and I know that his testimony is true.", "33": " You sent messengers to John, and he gave his testimony to the truth-", "34": " not that I depend on human testimony; no, it is for your salvation that I mention it.", "35": " John was a lamp lit and shining and for a time you were content to enjoy the light that he gave.", "36": " But my testimony is greater than John's: the deeds my Father has given me to perform, these same deeds of mine testify that the Father has sent me.", "37": " Besides, the Father who sent me bears witness to me himself. You have never heard his voice, you have never seen his shape,", "38": " and his word finds no home in you because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent.", "39": " You pore over the scriptures, believing that in them you can find eternal life; it is these scriptures that testify to me,", "40": " and yet you refuse to come to me to receive life!", "41": " Human glory means nothing to me.", "42": " Besides, I know you too well: you have no love of God in you.", "43": " I have come in the name of my Father and you refuse to accept me; if someone else should come in his own name you would accept him.", "44": " How can you believe, since you look to each other for glory and are not concerned with the glory that comes from the one God?", "45": " Do not imagine that I am going to accuse you before the Father: you have placed your hopes on Moses, and Moses will be the one who accuses you.", "46": " If you really believed him you would believe me too, since it was about me that he was writing;", "47": " but if you will not believe what he wrote, how can you believe what I say?"}
