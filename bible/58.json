{"1": " Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the Church in Thessalonica which is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.", "2": " We always thank God for you all, mentioning you in our prayers continually.", "3": " We remember before our God and Father how active is the faith, how unsparing the love, how persevering the hope which you have from our Lord Jesus Christ.", "4": " We know, brothers loved by God, that you have been chosen,", "5": " because our gospel came to you not only in words, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with great effect. And you observed the sort of life we lived when we were with you, which was for your sake.", "6": " You took us and the Lord as your model, welcoming the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit in spite of great hardship.", "7": " And so you became an example to all believers in Macedonia and Achaia", "8": " since it was from you that the word of the Lord rang out -- and not only throughout Macedonia and Achaia, for your faith in God has spread everywhere. We do not need to tell other people about it:", "9": " other people tell us how we started the work among you, how you broke with the worship of false gods when you were converted to God and became servants of the living and true God;", "10": " and how you are now waiting for Jesus, his Son, whom he raised from the dead, to come from heaven. It is he who saves us from the Retribution which is coming."},
{"1": " You know yourselves, my brothers, that our visit to you has not been pointless.", "2": " Although, as you know, we had received rough treatment and insults at Philippi, God gave us the courage to speak his gospel to you fearlessly, in spite of great opposition.", "3": " Our encouragement to you does not come from any delusion or impure motives or trickery.", "4": " No, God has approved us to be entrusted with the gospel, and this is how we preach, seeking to please not human beings but God who tests our hearts.", "5": " Indeed, we have never acted with the thought of flattering anyone, as you know, nor as an excuse for greed, God is our witness;", "6": " nor have we ever looked for honour from human beings, either from you or anybody else,", "7": " when we could have imposed ourselves on you with full weight, as apostles of Christ. Instead, we lived unassumingly among you. Like a mother feeding and looking after her children,", "8": " we felt so devoted to you, that we would have been happy to share with you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, so dear had you become.", "9": " You remember, brothers, with what unsparing energy we used to work, slaving night and day so as not to be a burden on any one of you while we were proclaiming the gospel of God to you.", "10": " You are witnesses, and so is God, that our treatment of you, since you believed, has been impeccably fair and upright.", "11": " As you know, we treated every one of you as a father treats his children,", "12": " urging you, encouraging you and appealing to you to live a life worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and his glory.", "13": " Another reason why we continually thank God for you is that as soon as you heard the word that we brought you as God's message, you welcomed it for what it really is, not the word of any human being, but God's word, a power that is working among you believers.", "14": " For you, my brothers, have modelled yourselves on the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judaea, in that you have suffered the same treatment from your own countrymen as they have had from the Jews,", "15": " who put the Lord Jesus to death, and the prophets too, and persecuted us also. Their conduct does not please God, and makes them the enemies of the whole human race,", "16": " because they are hindering us from preaching to gentiles to save them. Thus all the time they are reaching the full extent of their iniquity, but retribution has finally overtaken them.", "17": " Although we had been deprived of you for only a short time in body but never in affection, brothers, we had an especially strong desire and longing to see you face to face again,", "18": " and we tried hard to come and visit you; I, Paul, tried more than once, but Satan prevented us.", "19": " What do you think is our hope and our joy, and what our crown of honour in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes?", "20": " You are, for you are our pride and joy."},
{"1": " When we could not bear it any longer, we decided it would be best to be left without a companion at Athens,", "2": " and sent our brother Timothy, who is God's helper in spreading the gospel of Christ, to keep you firm and encourage you about your faith", "3": " and prevent any of you from being unsettled by the present hardships. As you know, these are bound to come our way:", "4": " indeed, when we were with you, we warned you that we are certain to have hardships to bear, and that is what has happened now, as you have found out.", "5": " That is why, when I could not bear it any longer, I sent to assure myself of your faith: I was afraid the Tester might have put you to the test, and all our work might have been pointless.", "6": " However, Timothy has returned from you and has given us good news of your faith and your love, telling us that you always remember us with pleasure and want to see us quite as much as we want to see you.", "7": " And so, brothers, your faith has been a great encouragement to us in the middle of our own distress and hardship;", "8": " now we can breathe again, as you are holding firm in the Lord.", "9": " How can we thank God enough for you, for all the joy we feel before our God on your account?", "10": " We are earnestly praying night and day to be able to see you face to face again and make up any shortcomings in your faith.", "11": " May God our Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, ease our path to you.", "12": " May the Lord increase and enrich your love for each other and for all, so that it matches ours for you.", "13": " And may he so confirm your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless in the sight of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones."},
{"1": " Finally, brothers, we urge you and appeal to you in the Lord Jesus; we instructed you how to live in the way that pleases God, and you are so living; but make more progress still.", "2": " You are well aware of the instructions we gave you on the authority of the Lord Jesus.", "3": " God wills you all to be holy. He wants you to keep away from sexual immorality,", "4": " and each one of you to know how to control his body in a way that is holy and honourable,", "5": " not giving way to selfish lust like the nations who do not acknowledge God.", "6": " He wants nobody at all ever to sin by taking advantage of a brother in these matters; the Lord always pays back sins of that sort, as we told you before emphatically.", "7": " God called us to be holy, not to be immoral;", "8": " in other words, anyone who rejects this is rejecting not human authority, but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.", "9": " As for brotherly love, there is no need to write to you about that, since you have yourselves learnt from God to love one another,", "10": " and in fact this is how you treat all the brothers throughout the whole of Macedonia. However, we do urge you, brothers, to go on making even greater progress", "11": " and to make a point of living quietly, attending to your own business and earning your living, just as we told you to,", "12": " so that you may earn the respect of outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.", "13": " We want you to be quite certain, brothers, about those who have fallen asleep, to make sure that you do not grieve for them, as others do who have no hope.", "14": " We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and that in the same way God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.", "15": " We can tell you this from the Lord's own teaching, that we who are still alive for the Lord's coming will not have any advantage over those who have fallen asleep.", "16": " At the signal given by the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet of God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven; those who have died in Christ will be the first to rise,", "17": " and only after that shall we who remain alive be taken up in the clouds, together with them, to meet the Lord in the air. This is the way we shall be with the Lord for ever.", "18": " With such thoughts as these, then, you should encourage one another."},
{"1": " About times and dates, brothers, there is no need to write to you", "2": " for you are well aware in any case that the Day of the Lord is going to come like a thief in the night.", "3": " It is when people are saying, 'How quiet and peaceful it is' that sudden destruction falls on them, as suddenly as labour pains come on a pregnant woman; and there is no escape.", "4": " But you, brothers, do not live in the dark, that the Day should take you unawares like a thief.", "5": " No, you are all children of light and children of the day: we do not belong to the night or to darkness,", "6": " so we should not go on sleeping, as everyone else does, but stay wide awake and sober.", "7": " Night is the time for sleepers to sleep and night the time for drunkards to be drunk,", "8": " but we belong to the day and we should be sober; let us put on faith and love for a breastplate, and the hope of salvation for a helmet.", "9": " God destined us not for his retribution, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,", "10": " who died for us so that, awake or asleep, we should still live united to him.", "11": " So give encouragement to each other, and keep strengthening one another, as you do already.", "12": " We appeal to you, my brothers, to be considerate to those who work so hard among you as your leaders in the Lord and those who admonish you.", "13": " Have the greatest respect and affection for them because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.", "14": " We urge you, brothers, to admonish those who are undisciplined, encourage the apprehensive, support the weak and be patient with everyone.", "15": " Make sure that people do not try to repay evil for evil; always aim at what is best for each other and for everyone.", "16": " Always be joyful;", "17": " pray constantly;", "18": " and for all things give thanks; this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.", "19": " Do not stifle the Spirit", "20": " or despise the gift of prophecy with contempt;", "21": " test everything and hold on to what is good", "22": " and shun every form of evil.", "23": " May the God of peace make you perfect and holy; and may your spirit, life and body be kept blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.", "24": " He who has called you is trustworthy and will carry it out.", "25": " Pray for us, my brothers.", "26": " Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.", "27": " My orders, in the Lord's name, are that this letter is to be read to all the brothers.", "28": " The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."}
