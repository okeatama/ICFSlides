So tell me what my dream was, and then I shall know whether you can interpret it.'", "10": " The Chaldaeans answered the king, 'Nobody in the world could explain the king's problem; what is more, no other king, governor or chief would think of putting such a question to any magician, soothsayer or Chaldaean.", "11": " The question the king asks is difficult, and no one can find the king an answer to it, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.'", "12": " At this the king flew into a rage and ordered all the Babylonian sages to be put to death.", "13": " On publication of the decree to have the sages killed, search was made for Daniel and his companions to have them put to death.", "14": " Then, with shrewd and cautious words, Daniel approached Arioch, the king's chief executioner, when he was on his way to kill the Babylonian sages.", "15": " To this royal official Arioch he said, 'Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?'

{"1": " In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim.", "2": " He was married to a woman called Susanna daughter of Hilkiah, a woman of great beauty; and she was God-fearing, for", "3": " her parents were worthy people and had instructed their daughter in the Law of Moses.", "4": " Joakim was a very rich man and had a garden by his house; he used to be visited by a considerable number of the Jews, since he was held in greater respect than any other man.", "5": " Two elderly men had been selected from the people, that year, to act as judges. Of such the Lord had said, 'Wickedness has come to Babylon through the elders and judges posing as guides to the people.'", "6": " These men were often at Joakim's house, and all who were engaged in litigation used to come to them.", "7": " At midday, when the people had gone away, Susanna would take a walk in her husband's garden.", "8": " The two elders, who used to watch her every day as she came in to take her walk, gradually began to desire her.", "9": " They threw reason aside, making no effort to turn their eyes to Heaven, and forgetting the demands of virtue.", "10": " Both were inflamed by passion for her, but they hid their desire from each other,", "11": " for they were ashamed to admit the longing to sleep with her,", "12": " but they made sure of watching her every day.", "13": " One day, having parted with the words, 'Let us go home, then, it is time for the midday meal,' they went off in different directions,", "14": " only to retrace their steps and find themselves face to face again. Obliged then to explain, they admitted their desire and agreed to look for an opportunity of surprising her alone.", "15": " So they waited for a favourable moment; and one day Susanna came as usual, accompanied only by two young maidservants. The day was hot and she wanted to bathe in the garden.", "16": " There was no one about except the two elders, spying on her from their hiding place.", "17": " She said to the servants, 'Bring me some oil and balsam and shut the garden door while I bathe.'", "18": " They did as they were told, shutting the garden door and going back to the house by a side entrance to fetch what she had asked for; they knew nothing about the elders, for they had concealed themselves.", "19": " Hardly were the maids gone than the two elders sprang up and rushed upon her.", "20": " 'Look,' they said, 'the garden door is shut, no one can see us. We want to have you, so give in and let us!", "21": " Refuse, and we shall both give evidence that a young man was with you and that this was why you sent your maids away.'", "22": " Susanna sighed. 'I am trapped,' she said, 'whatever I do. If I agree, it means death for me; if I resist, I cannot get away from you.", "23": " But I prefer to fall innocent into your power than to sin in the eyes of the Lord.'", "24": " She then cried out as loud as she could. The two elders began shouting too, putting the blame on her,", "25": " and one of them ran to open the garden door.", "26": " The household, hearing the shouting in the garden, rushed out by the side entrance to see what had happened to her.", "27": " Once the elders had told their story, the servants were thoroughly taken aback, since nothing of this sort had ever been said of Susanna.", "28": " Next day a meeting was held at the house of her husband Joakim. The two elders arrived, full of their wicked plea against Susanna, to have her put to death.", "29": " They addressed the company, 'Summon Susanna daughter of Hilkiah and wife of Joakim.'

She shut the garden door and then dismissed the servants.", "37": " A young man, who had been hiding, went over to her and they lay together.", "38": " From the end of the garden where we were, we saw this crime taking place and hurried towards them.", "39": " Though we saw them together, we were unable to catch the man: he was too strong for us; he opened the door and took to his heels.", "40": " We did, however, catch this woman and ask her who the young man was.", "41": " She refused to tell us. That is our evidence.' Since they were elders of the people and judges, the assembly accepted their word: Susanna was condemned to death.", "42": " She cried out as loud as she could, 'Eternal God, you know all secrets and everything before it happens;", "43": " you know that they have given false evidence against me. And now I must die, innocent as I am of everything their malice has invented against me!'", "44": " The Lord heard her cry", "45": " and, as she was being led away to die, he roused the holy spirit residing in a young boy called Daniel", "46": " who began to shout, 'I am innocent of this woman's death!'", "47": " At this all the people turned to him and asked, 'What do you mean by that?'", "48": " Standing in the middle of the crowd, he replied, 'Are you so stupid, children of Israel, as to condemn a daughter of Israel unheard, and without troubling to find out the truth?", "49": " Go back to the scene of the trial: these men have given false evidence against her.'", "50": " All the people hurried back, and the elders said to Daniel, 'Come and sit with us and tell us what you mean, since God has given you the gifts that elders have.'", "51": " Daniel said, 'Keep the men well apart from each other, for I want to question them.'", "52": " When the men had been separated, Daniel had one of them brought to him.

He replied, 'Under an acacia tree.'", "55": " Daniel said, 'Indeed! Your lie recoils on your own head: the angel of God has already received from him your sentence and will cut you in half.'", "56": " He dismissed the man, ordered the other to be brought and said to him, 'Son of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you, lust has led your heart astray!", "57": " This is how you have been behaving with the daughters of Israel, and they have been too frightened to resist; but here is a daughter of Judah who could not stomach your wickedness!", "58": " Now then, tell me what sort of tree you surprised them under.' He replied, 'Under an aspen tree.'", "59": " Daniel said, 'Indeed! Your lie recoils on your own head: the angel of God is waiting with a sword to rend you in half, and destroy the pair of you.'", "60": " Then the whole assembly shouted, blessing God, the Saviour of those who trust in him.", "61": " And they turned on the two elders whom Daniel had convicted of false evidence out of their own mouths.", "62": " As the Law of Moses prescribes, they were given the same punishment as they had schemed to inflict on their neighbour. They were put to death. And thus, that day, an innocent life was saved.", "63": " Hilkiah and his wife gave thanks to God for their daughter Susanna, and so did her husband Joakim and all his relations, because she had been acquitted of anything dishonourable.", "64": " From that day onwards, Daniel's reputation stood high with the people."},
{"1": " When King Astyages joined his ancestors, Cyrus of Persia succeeded him.", "2": " Daniel was very close to the king, who respected him more than any of his other friends.", "3": " Now, in Babylon there was an idol called Bel, to which twelve bushels of the finest flour, forty sheep and six measures of wine were offered every day.", "4": " The king venerated this idol and used to go and worship it every day. Daniel, however, worshipped his own God.", "5": " 'Why do you not worship Bel?' the king asked Daniel. 'I do not worship idols made by human hand,' Daniel replied, 'I worship the living God who made heaven and earth and who is lord over all living creatures.'", "6": " 'Do you not believe, then,' said the king, 'that Bel is a living god? Can you not see how much he eats and drinks each day?'", "7": " Daniel laughed. 'Your Majesty,' he said, 'do not be taken in; he is clay inside, and bronze outside, and has never eaten or drunk anything.'", "8": " This made the king angry; he summoned his priests, 'Tell me who eats all this food,' he said, 'or die. Prove to me that Bel really eats it, and I will have Daniel put to death for blaspheming him.'", "9": " Daniel said to the king, 'Let it be as you say.'", "10": " There were seventy of these priests, to say nothing of their wives and children. The king went to the temple of Bel, taking Daniel with him.", "11": " The priests of Bel said to him, 'We shall now go out, and you, Your Majesty, will lay out the meal and mix the wine and set it out. Then, lock the door and seal it with your personal seal. If, when you return in the morning, you do not find that everything has been eaten by Bel,let us be put to death; otherwise let Daniel, that slanderer!'", "12": " They were thinking -- hence their confidence -- of a secret entrance which they had made under the table, and by which they came in regularly and took the offerings away.", "13": " When the priests had gone and the king had set out the food for Bel,", "14": " Daniel made his servants bring ashes and spread them all over the temple floor, with no other witness than the king. They then left the building, shut the door and, sealing it with the king's seal, went away.", "15": " That night, as usual, the priests came with their wives and children; they ate and drank everything.", "16": " The king was up very early next morning, and Daniel with him.", "17": " 'Daniel,' said the king, 'are the seals intact?' 'They are intact, Your Majesty,' he replied.", "18": " The king then opened the door and, taking one look at the table, exclaimed, 'You are great, O Bel! There is no deception in you!'", "19": " But Daniel laughed; and, restraining the king from going in any further, he said, 'Look at the floor and take note whose footmarks these are!'", "20": " 'I can see the footmarks of men, of women and of children,' said the king,", "21": " and angrily ordered the priests to be arrested, with their wives and children. They then showed him the secret door through which they used to come and take what was on the table.", "22": " The king had them put to death and handed Bel over to Daniel who destroyed both the idol and its temple.", "23": " There was a great dragon which the Babylonians worshipped too.", "24": " The king said to Daniel, 'Are you going to tell me that this is made of bronze? Look, it is alive; it eats and drinks; you cannot deny that this is a living god; worship it, then.'", "25": " Daniel replied, 'I will worship the Lord my God; he is the living God. With your permission, Your Majesty, without using either sword or club, I shall kill this dragon.'", "26": " 'You have my permission,' said the king.", "27": " Whereupon, Daniel took some pitch, some fat and some hair and boiled them up together, rolled the mixture into balls and fed them to the dragon; the dragon swallowed them and burst. Daniel said, 'Now look at the sort of thing you worship!'", "28": " The Babylonians were furious when they heard about this and rose against the king. 'The king has turned Jew,' they said, 'he has allowed Bel to be overthrown, and the dragon to be killed, and he has put the priests to death.'", "29": " So they went to the king and said, 'Hand Daniel over to us or else we shall kill you and your family.'", "30": " They pressed him so hard that the king found himself forced to hand Daniel over to them.", "31": " They threw Daniel into the lion pit, and there he stayed for six days.", "32": " In the pit were seven lions, which were given two human bodies and two sheep every day; but for this period they were not given anything, to make sure they would eat Daniel.", "33": " Now, the prophet Habakkuk was in Judaea: he had been making a stew and breaking up bread into a basket. He was on his way to the fields, taking this to the harvesters,", "34": " when the angel of the Lord spoke to him, 'Take the meal you are carrying to Babylon, and give it to Daniel in the lion pit.'", "35": " 'Lord,' replied Habakkuk, 'I have not even seen Babylon and know nothing about this pit.'", "36": " The angel of the Lord took hold of his head and carried him off by the hair to Babylon where, with a great blast of his breath, he set Habakkuk down on the edge of the pit.", "37": " 'Daniel, Daniel,' Habakkuk shouted, 'take the meal that God has sent you.'", "38": " And Daniel said, 'You have kept me in mind, O God; you have not deserted those who love you.'", "39": " Rising to his feet, he ate the meal, while the angel of God carried Habakkuk back in a moment to his own country.", "40": " On the seventh day, the king came to lament over Daniel; on reaching the pit he looked inside, and there sat Daniel.", "41": " 'You are great, O Lord, God of Daniel,' he exclaimed, 'there is no god but you!'", "42": " He then had Daniel released from the pit and the plotters of Daniel's ruin thrown in instead, where they were instantly eaten before his eyes."}
