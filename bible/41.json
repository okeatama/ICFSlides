{"1": " The charge that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision.", "2": " How long, Yahweh, am I to cry for help while you will not listen; to cry, 'Violence!' in your ear while you will not save?", "3": " Why do you make me see wrong-doing, why do you countenance oppression? Plundering and violence confront me, contention and discord flourish.", "4": " And so the law loses its grip and justice never emerges, since the wicked outwits the upright and so justice comes out perverted.", "5": " Cast your eyes over the nations, look, and be amazed, astounded. For I am doing something in your own days which you will not believe if you are told of it.", "6": " For look, I am stirring up the Chaldaeans, that fierce and fiery nation who march miles across country to seize the homes of others.", "7": " They are dreadful and awesome, a law and authority to themselves.", "8": " Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at night; their horsemen gallop on, their horsemen advance from afar, swooping like an eagle anxious to feed.", "9": " They are all bent on violence, their faces scorching like an east wind; they scoop up prisoners like sand.", "10": " They scoff at kings, they despise princes. They make light of all fortresses: they heap up earth and take them.", "11": " Then the wind changes and is gone . . . Guilty is he who makes his strength his god.", "12": " Surely you, Yahweh, are from ancient times, my holy God, who never dies! Yahweh, you have appointed him to execute judgement; O Rock, you have set him firm to punish.", "13": " Your eyes are too pure to rest on evil, you cannot look on at oppression. Why do you look on at those who play the traitor, why say nothing while the wicked swallows someone more upright than himself?", "14": " Why treat people like fish of the sea, like gliding creatures who have no leader?", "15": " They haul them all up on their hook, they catch them in their net, they sweep them up in their dragnet and then make merry and rejoice.", "16": " And so they offer a sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their dragnet, for by these they get a rich living and live off the fat of the land.", "17": " Are they to go on emptying their net unceasingly, slaughtering the nations without pity?"},
{"1": " I shall stand at my post, I shall station myself on my watch-tower, watching to see what he will say to me, what answer he will make to my complaints.", "2": " Then Yahweh answered me and said, 'Write the vision down, inscribe it on tablets to be easily read.", "3": " For the vision is for its appointed time, it hastens towards its end and it will not lie; although it may take some time, wait for it, for come it certainly will before too long.", "4": " 'You see, anyone whose heart is not upright will succumb, but the upright will live through faithfulness.'", "5": " Now, surely, wealth is treacherous! He is arrogant, for ever on the move, with appetite as large as Sheol and as insatiable as Death, gathering in all the nations, and making a harvest of all peoples.", "6": " Are not the peoples all bound to satirise and make up cryptic riddles about him? As for instance: Disaster to anyone who amasses goods not his (for how long?) and to anyone who weighs himself down with goods taken in pledge!", "7": " Will not your creditors suddenly stand up, will not those who make you shiver wake up, and you will fall a prey to them?", "8": " Since you have plundered many nations, all the nations that remain will plunder you, because of the bloodshed and violence done to the country, to the city and to all who live in it.", "9": " Disaster to anyone who amasses ill-gotten gains for his house, so as to fix his nest on high and so evade the reach of misfortune!", "10": " You have conspired to bring shame on your house: by overthrowing many peoples you have worked your own ruin.", "11": " For the very stone will protest from the wall, and the beam will respond from the framework.", "12": " Disaster to anyone who builds a town with bloodshed and founds a city on wrong-doing!", "13": " Is it not thanks to Yahweh Sabaoth that the peoples' toil is fuel for the fire, and the nations' labour came to nothing?", "14": " But the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh as the waters cover the depths of the sea.", "15": " Disaster to anyone who makes his neighbours drink, pouring out his poison until they are drunk, so that he can see them naked!", "16": " You are full of shame, not glory! Your turn now to drink and show your foreskin. The cup in Yahweh's right hand comes round to you, and disgrace will overshadow your glory.", "17": " For the violence done to the Lebanon will overwhelm you and the massacre of animals will terrify you, because of the bloodshed and violence done to the country, to the city and to all who live in it. Disaster to anyone who says to the log, 'Wake up!', to the dumb stone, 'On your feet!' (This is the prophecy!) Look, he is encased in gold and silver,-- but not a breath of life inside it! ", "18": " What use is a sculpted image that a sculptor should make it? - a metal image, a lying instructor! And why does the image-maker put his trust in it, that he should make dumb idols?", "19": " Trouble is coming to the man who says to the piece of wood, 'Wake up!' to the dumb stone, 'On your feet!' (And that is the oracle.) Plated it may be with gold and silver, but not a breath of life inside it.", "20": " But Yahweh is in his holy Temple: let the whole earth be silent before him."},
{"1": " A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk; tone as for dirges.", "2": " Yahweh, I have heard of your renown; your work, Yahweh, inspires me with dread. Make it live again in our time, make it known in our time; in wrath remember mercy.", "3": " Eloah comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. His majesty covers the heavens, and his glory fills the earth.", "4": " His brightness is like the day, rays flash from his hands, that is where his power lies hidden.", "5": " Pestilence goes before him and Plague follows close behind.", "6": " When he stands up, he makes the earth tremble, with his glance he makes the nations quake. And the eternal mountains are dislodged, the everlasting hills sink down, his pathway from of old.", "7": " I saw the tents of Cushan in trouble, the tent-curtains of Midian shuddering.", "8": " Yahweh, are you enraged with the rivers, are you angry with the sea, that you should mount your chargers, your rescuing chariots?", "9": " You uncover your bow, and give the string its fill of arrows. You drench the soil with torrents;", "10": " the mountains see you and tremble, great floods sweep by, the abyss roars aloud, lifting high its waves.", "11": " Sun and moon stay inside their dwellings, they flee at the light of your arrows, at the flash of your lightning-spear.", "12": " In rage you stride across the land, in anger you trample the nations.", "13": " You marched to save your people, to save your anointed one; you wounded the head of the house of the wicked, laid bare the foundation to the rock.", "14": " With your shafts you pierced the leader of his warriors who stormed out with shouts of joy to scatter us, as if they meant to devour some poor wretch in their lair.", "15": " With your horses you trampled through the sea, through the surging abyss!", "16": " When I heard, I trembled to the core, my lips quivered at the sound; my bones became disjointed and my legs gave way beneath me. Calmly I await the day of anguish which is dawning on the people now attacking us.", "17": " (For the fig tree is not to blossom, nor will the vines bear fruit, the olive crop will disappoint and the fields will yield no food; the sheep will vanish from the fold; no cattle in the stalls.)", "18": " But I shall rejoice in Yahweh, I shall exult in God my Saviour.", "19": " Yahweh my Lord is my strength, he will make my feet as light as a doe's, and set my steps on the heights. For the choirmaster; on stringed instruments."}
