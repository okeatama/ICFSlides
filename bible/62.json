I want you to be quite uncompromising in teaching all this, so that those who now believe in God may keep their minds constantly occupied in doing good works. All this is good, and useful for everybody.", "9": " But avoid foolish speculations, and those genealogies, and the quibbles and disputes about the Law -- they are useless and futile.", "10": " If someone disputes what you teach, then after a first and a second warning, have no more to do with him:", "11": " you will know that anyone of that sort is warped and is self-condemned as a sinner.", "12": " As soon as I have sent Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to join me at Nicopolis, where I have decided to spend the winter.", "13": " Help eagerly on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, and make sure they have everything they need.", "14": " All our people must also learn to occupy themselves in doing good works for their practical needs, and not to be unproductive.", "15": " All those who are with me send their greetings.
