It is, then, about my weaknesses that I am happiest of all to boast, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me;", "10": " and that is why I am glad of weaknesses, insults, constraints, persecutions and distress for Christ's sake. For it is when I am weak that I am strong.", "11": " I have turned into a fool, but you forced me to it. It is you that should have been commending me; those super-apostles had no advantage over me, even if I am nothing at all.", "12": " All the marks characteristic of a true apostle have been at work among you: complete perseverance, signs, marvels, demonstrations of power.", "13": " Is there any way in which you have been given less than the rest of the churches, except that I did not make myself a burden to you? Forgive me for this unfairness!", "14": " Here I am, ready to come to you for the third time and I am not going to be a burden on you: it is not your possessions that I want, but yourselves. Children are not expected to save up for their parents, but parents for their children,", "15": " and I am more than glad to spend what I have and to be spent for the sake of your souls. Is it because I love you so much more, that I am loved the less?", "16": " All right, then; I did not make myself a burden to you, but, trickster that I am, I caught you by trickery.", "17": " Have I taken advantage of you through any of the people I have sent to you?", "18": " Titus came at my urging, and I sent his companion with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Can you deny that he and I were following the guidance of the same Spirit and were on the same tracks?", "19": " All this time you have been thinking that we have been pleading our own cause before you; no, we have been speaking in Christ and in the presence of God -- and all, dear friends, to build you up.", "20": " I am afraid that in one way or another, when I come, I may find you different from what I should like you to be, and you may find me what you would not like me to be; so that in one way or the other there will be rivalry, jealousy, bad temper, quarrels, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorders;", "21": " and when I come again, my God may humiliate me in front of you and I shall be grieved by all those who sinned in the past and have still not repented of the impurities and sexual immorality and debauchery that they have committed."},
{"1": " This will be the third time I have confronted you. Whatever the misdemeanour, the evidence of two or three witnesses is required to sustain a charge.", "2": " I gave you notice once, and now, though I am not with you, I give notice again, just as when I was with you for a second time, to those who sinned before, and to all others; and it is to this effect, that when I do come next time, I shall have no mercy.", "3": " Since you are asking for a proof that it is Christ who speaks in me; he is not weak with you but his power is at work among you;", "4": " for, though it was out of weakness that he was crucified, he is alive now with the power of God. We, too, are weak in him, but with regard to you we shall live with him by the power of God.", "5": " Put yourselves to the test to make sure you are in the faith. Examine yourselves. Do you not recognise yourselves as people in whom Jesus Christ is present? - unless, that is, you fail the test.", "6": " But we, as I hope you will come to recognise, do not fail the test.", "7": " It is our prayer to God that you may do nothing wrong -- not so that we have the credit of passing a test, but because you will be doing what is right, even if we do not pass the test.", "8": " We have no power to resist the truth; only to further the truth;", "9": " and we are delighted to be weak if only you are strong. What we ask in our prayers is that you should be made perfect.", "10": " That is why I am writing this while still far away, so that when I am with you I shall not have to be harsh, with the authority that the Lord has given me, an authority that is for building up and not for breaking down.", "11": " To end then, brothers, we wish you joy; try to grow perfect; encourage one another; have a common mind and live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.", "12": " Greet one another with the holy kiss. All God's holy people send you their greetings.", "13": " The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."}
