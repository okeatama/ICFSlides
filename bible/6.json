But Samson said to his father, 'Get that one for me; she is the one I am for me; she is the one I am fond of.'", "4": " His father and mother did not know that all this came from Yahweh, who was seeking grounds for a quarrel with the Philistines, since at this time the Philistines dominated Israel.", "5": " Samson went down to Timnah and, as he reached the vineyards of Timnah, he saw a young lion coming roaring towards him.", "6": " The spirit of Yahweh seized on him and he tore the lion to pieces with his bare hands as though it were a kid; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.", "7": " He went down and talked to the woman, and he became fond of her.", "8": " Not long after this, Samson went back to marry her. He went out of his way to look at the carcase of the lion, and there was a swarm of bees in the lion's body, and honey.", "9": " He took up some honey in his hand and ate it as he went along. On returning to his father and mother, he gave some to them, which they ate too, but he did not tell them that he had taken it from the lion's carcase.", "10": " His father then went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, as is the custom for young men.", "11": " And when the Philistines saw him, they chose thirty companions to stay with him.", "12": " Samson then said to them, 'Let me ask you a riddle. If you can give me the answer during the seven days of feasting, I shall give you thirty pieces of fine linen and thirty festal robes.", "13": " But if you cannot tell me the answer, then you in your turn must give me thirty pieces of fine linen and thirty festal robes.' 'Ask your riddle,' they replied, 'we are listening.'", "14": " So he said to them: Out of the eater came what is eaten, and out of the strong came what is sweet. But three days went by and they could not solve the riddle.", "15": " On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, 'Cajole your husband into explaining the riddle to us, or we shall burn you and your father's family to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?'", "16": " Samson's wife then went to him in tears and said, 'You only hate me, you do not love me. You have asked my fellow countrymen a riddle and told not even me the answer.' He said to her, 'I have not told even my father or mother; why should I tell you?'", "17": " She wept on his neck for the seven days that their feasting lasted. She was so persistent that on the seventh day he told her the answer, and she told her fellow-countrymen.", "18": " So on the seventh day, before he went into the bedroom, the men of the town said to him: What is sweeter than honey, and what stronger than a lion? He retorted: If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you would never have solved my riddle.", "19": " Then the spirit of Yahweh seized on him. He went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men there, took what they wore and gave the festal robes to those who had answered the riddle, then burning with rage returned to his father's house.", "20": " Samson's wife was then given to the companion who had acted as his best man."},
{"1": " Not long after this, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, with a kid; he said, 'I wish to go to my wife in her room.' But her father would not let him enter.", "2": " 'I felt sure', he said, 'that you had taken a real dislike to her, so I gave her to your companion. But would not her younger sister suit you better? Have her instead.'", "3": " But Samson answered them, 'I can get my revenge on the Philistines now only by doing them some damage.'", "4": " So Samson went off and caught three hundred foxes, then took torches and, turning the foxes tail to tail, put a torch between each pair of tails.", "5": " He lit the torches and set the foxes free in the Philistines' cornfields. In this way he burned both sheaves and standing corn, and the vines and olive trees as well.", "6": " The Philistines asked, 'Who has done this?' and received the answer, 'Samson, who married the Timnite's daughter; his father-in-law took the wife back again and gave her to his companion instead.' The Philistines then went and burned the woman and her father's family to death.", "7": " Samson said to them, 'If that is how you behave, I swear I will not rest till I have had my revenge on you.'", "8": " And he fell on them systematically and caused great havoc. Then he went down to the cave in the Rock of Etham and lived there.", "9": " The Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a foray against Lehi.", "10": " The men of Judah said to them, 'Why are you attacking us?' They replied, 'We have come to seize Samson and to treat him as he has treated us.'", "11": " Three thousand men of Judah then went down to the cave of the Rock of Etham and said to him, 'Don't you know that the Philistines have us in their power? Now what have you done to us?' He replied, 'I have treated them only as they treated me.'", "12": " They then said, 'We have come down to take you, to hand you over to the Philistines.' He said, 'Swear to me not to kill me yourselves.'", "13": " They replied, 'No; we only want to bind you and hand you over to them; we certainly do not want to kill you.' They then bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the Rock.", "14": " As he was approaching Lehi, and the Philistines came running towards him with triumphant shouts, the spirit of Yahweh was on him; the ropes on his arms became like burnt strands of flax and the cords round his hands came untied.", "15": " Coming across the fresh jawbone of a donkey, he reached out and snatched it up; and with it he slaughtered a thousand men.", "16": " And Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey I have laid them in heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have felled a thousand men.", "17": " And with that he hurled the jawbone away; and that is why the place was called Ramath-Lehi.", "18": " And as he was very thirsty, he called on Yahweh and said, 'You yourself have worked this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now must I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?'", "19": " Then God opened a hollow in the ground, the hollow there is at Lehi, and water gushed out of it. Samson drank; his vigour returned and he revived. And therefore this spring was called En-ha-Kore; it is still at Lehi today.", "20": " Samson was judge in Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years."},
{"1": " Samson then went to Gaza and, seeing a prostitute there, went in to her.", "2": " The men of Gaza being told, 'Samson has arrived,' surrounded the place and kept watch for him the whole night at the town gate. All that night they were going to make no move, thinking, 'Let us wait until daybreak, and then kill him.'", "3": " Till midnight, however, Samson stayed in bed, and then at midnight he got up, seized the doors of the town gate and the two posts as well; he tore them up, bar and all, hoisted them on to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron.", "4": " After this, he fell in love with a woman in the Vale of Sorek; she was called Delilah.", "5": " The Philistine chiefs visited her and said, 'Cajole him and find out where his great strength comes from, and how we can master him, so that we can bind him and subdue him. In return we shall each give you eleven hundred silver shekels.'", "6": " Delilah said to Samson, 'Please tell me where your great strength comes from, and what would be needed to bind and subdue you.'", "7": " Samson replied, 'If I were bound with seven new bowstrings which had not yet been dried, I should lose my strength and become like any other man.'", "8": " The Philistine chiefs brought Delilah seven new bowstrings which had not yet been dried and she took them and bound him with them.", "9": " She had men concealed in her room, and she shouted, 'The Philistines are on you, Samson!' Then he snapped the bowstrings as a strand of tow snaps at a touch of the fire. So the secret of his strength remained unknown.", "10": " Delilah then said to Samson, 'You have been laughing at me and telling me lies. But now please tell me what would be needed to bind you.'", "11": " He replied, 'If I were bound tightly with new ropes which have never been used, I should lose my strength and become like any other man.'", "12": " Delilah then took new ropes and bound him with them, and she shouted, 'The Philistines are on you, Samson!' She had men concealed in her room, but he snapped the ropes round his arms like thread.", "13": " Delilah then said to Samson, 'Up to now you have been laughing at me and telling me lies. Tell me what would be needed to bind you.' He replied, 'If you wove the seven locks of my hair into the warp of a cloth and beat them together tight with the reed, I should lose my strength and become like any other man.'", "14": " She lulled him to sleep, then wove the seven locks of his hair into the warp, beat them together tight with the reed and shouted, 'The Philistines are on you, Samson!' He woke from his sleep and pulled out both reed and warp. So the secret of his strength remained unknown.", "15": " Delilah said to him, 'How can you say that you love me, when your heart is not with me? Three times now you have laughed at me and have not told me where your great strength comes from.'", "16": " And day after day she pestered him with her talk, nagging him till he grew sick to death of it.", "17": " At last he confided everything to her; he said to her, 'A razor has never touched my head, because I have been God's nazirite from my mother's womb. If my head were shorn, then my power would leave me and I should lose my strength and become like any other man.'", "18": " Delilah then realized that he had really confided in her; she sent for the Philistine princes with the message, 'Come just once more: he has confided everything to me.' And the Philistine chiefs came to her with the money in their hands.", "19": " She lulled Samson to sleep in her lap, summoned a man and had him shear off the seven locks from his head. Thus for the first time she got control over him, and his strength left him.", "20": " She cried, 'The Philistines are on you, Samson!' He awoke from sleep, thinking, 'I shall break free as I have done time after time and shake myself clear.' But he did not know that Yahweh had left him.", "21": " The Philistines seized him, put out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. They fettered him with a double chain of bronze and he spent his time turning the mill in the prison.", "22": " But his hair began to grow again when it had been cut off.", "23": " The Philistine chiefs assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god. And amid their festivities they said: Into our hands our god has delivered Samson our enemy.", "24": " And as soon as the people saw their god, they acclaimed him, shouting his praises: Into our hands our god has delivered Samson our enemy, the man who laid our country waste and killed so many of us.", "25": " And as their hearts were full of joy, they shouted, 'Summon Samson out to amuse us.' So Samson was summoned from prison, and he performed feats in front of them; then he was put to stand between the pillars.", "26": " Samson then said to the boy who was leading him by the hand, 'Lead me where I can touch the pillars supporting the building, so that I can lean against them.'", "27": " Now the building was crowded with men and women. All the Philistine chiefs were there, while about three thousand men and women were watching Samson's feats from the terrace.", "28": " Samson called on Yahweh and cried out, 'Lord Yahweh, I beg you, remember me; give me strength again this once, O God, and let me be revenged on the Philistines at one blow for my two eyes.'", "29": " And Samson took hold of the two central pillars supporting the building, and braced himself with his right arm round one and his left round the other;", "30": " and he shouted, 'Let me die with the Philistines!' He then heaved with all his might, and the building fell on the chiefs and on all the people there. Those whom he brought to their death by his death outnumbered those whom he had done to death during his life.", "31": " His brothers and the whole of his father's family came down and carried him away.

Look, I have got that silver. I was the one who took it.' His mother said, 'May Yahweh bless my boy!'", "3": " He gave the eleven hundred shekels back to his mother, who said, 'I have indeed vowed to give this silver to Yahweh for my son, to have a statue carved and an idol cast in metal, but now I should like to give it back to you.' He, however, returned the money to his mother.", "4": " His mother then took two hundred silver shekels and gave them to the metalworker. With them, he carved a statue (and cast an idol in metal) which was put in Micayehu's house.", "5": " This man Micah owned a shrine; he made an ephod and some domestic images, and installed one of his sons to be his priest.", "6": " In those days there was no king in Israel, and everyone did as he saw fit.", "7": " There was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the clan of Judah, who was a Levite and resided there as a stranger.", "8": " This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to settle wherever he could find a home.

I am travelling, and am going to settle wherever I can find a home.'", "10": " Micah said to him, 'Stay here with me; be my father and priest and I shall give you ten silver shekels a year, and clothing and food.'", "11": " The Levite agreed to remain in the man's house, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.", "12": " Micah installed the Levite; the young man became Micah's priest and stayed in his house.", "13": " And Micah said, 'Now I know that Yahweh will treat me well, since I have this Levite as priest.'"},

Now in those days the tribe of Dan was in search of a territory to live in, for until then no territory had fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.", "2": " From their clan the Danites sent five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to reconnoitre the country and explore it. They said to them, 'Go and explore the country.' The five men came to the highlands of Ephraim, as far as Micah's house, and spent the night there.", "3": " When they were near Micah's house, they recognised the voice of the young Levite and, going nearer, said to him, 'Who brought you here? What are you doing here? What is keeping you here?'", "4": " He replied, 'Micah has made certain arrangements with me. He pays me a wage and I act as his priest.'", "5": " They replied, 'Then consult God, so that we may know whether the journey we are on will lead to success.'", "6": " The priest replied, 'Go in peace; Yahweh is watching over your journey.'", "7": " The five men then left and, arriving at Laish, saw that the people living there had an untroubled existence, according to the customs of the Sidonians, peaceful and trusting, that there was no lack or shortage of any sort in the territory, that they were a long way away from the Sidonians and that they had no contact with the Aramaeans.", "8": " They then went back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol and, when the latter asked them, 'What have you to report?'", "9": " they said, 'Up! we must go against them, since we have looked at the country and it is excellent, though you take no action! Waste no time in setting out and taking possession of the country.", "10": " When you get there, you will find a trusting people. The country is wide, and God has put it at your mercy. It is a place where there is no lack of anything on earth.'", "11": " From these places, consequently, from the clan of Danites at Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred men set out equipped for war.", "12": " They went up and camped at Kiriath-Jearim in Judah; and for this reason the place is still called the Camp of Dan today. It lies to the west of Kiriath-Jearim.", "13": " From there they entered the highlands of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.", "14": " The five men who had been to reconnoitre the country then spoke to their brothers. 'Do you know', they said, 'that in these houses there is an ephod, some domestic images, a carved statue and an idol cast in metal? So now work out what you have got to do!", "15": " So, turning off the road, they went to the young Levite's dwelling, to Micah's house, and greeted him peacefully.", "16": " While the six hundred men of the Danites, equipped for war, stood at the threshold of the gate,", "17": " the five who had been to reconnoitre the country went on into the house and took the carved statue, the ephod, the domestic images and the idol cast in metal; meanwhile the priest remained at the threshold of the gate with the six hundred men equipped for war.", "18": " These men, having entered Micah's house, took the carved statue, the ephod, the domestic images and the idol cast in metal. The priest, however, said, 'What are you doing?'", "19": " 'Be quiet,' they replied. 'Put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and become our father and priest. Are you better off as domestic priest to one man, or as priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?'", "20": " The priest was delighted; he took the ephod, the domestic images and the carved statue, and went off among the people.", "21": " Resuming their original line of march, they set off, having put the women, children, livestock and baggage out in front.", "22": " They had gone some distance from Micah's house, when the people living in the houses near Micah's house raised the alarm and set off in pursuit of the Danites.", "23": " As they shouted after the Danites, the latter, turning about, said to Micah, 'What is the matter with you, that you are shouting like this?'", "24": " He replied, 'You have taken away my god, which I have had made, and the priest as well. You are going away, and what have I got left?

They put it to the sword and they burned down the town.", "28": " There was no one to come to the rescue, since it was a long way from Sidon and had no contact with the Aramaeans.

The servant said to his master, 'Come on, please, let us turn off into this Jebusite town and spend the night there.'", "12": " His master replied, 'We shall not turn off into a town of foreigners, of people who are not Israelites; we shall go on to Gibeah.'", "13": " He then said to his servant, 'Come on, we shall try to reach one or other of those places, either Gibeah or Ramah, and spend the night there.'", "14": " So they kept going and went on with their journey. As they approached Gibeah in Benjamin, the sun was setting.", "15": " So they turned that way to spend the night in Gibeah. Once inside, the Levite sat down in the town square, but no one offered to take them in for the night.", "16": " Eventually, an old man came along at nightfall from his work in the fields. He too was from the highlands of Ephraim, although he was living in Gibeah; the people of the place, however, were Benjaminites.", "17": " Looking up, he saw the traveller in the town square.

Ill-treat her, do what you please with her, but do not commit such an infamy against this man.'", "25": " But the men would not listen to him.
