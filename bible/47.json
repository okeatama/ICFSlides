{"1": " The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.", "2": " It is written in the prophet Isaiah: Look, I am going to send my messenger in front of you to prepare your way before you.", "3": " A voice of one that cries in the desert: Prepare a way for the Lord, make his paths straight.", "4": " John the Baptist was in the desert, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.", "5": " All Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem made their way to him, and as they were baptised by him in the river Jordan they confessed their sins.", "6": " John wore a garment of camel-skin, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.", "7": " In the course of his preaching he said, 'After me is coming someone who is more powerful than me, and I am not fit to kneel down and undo the strap of his sandals.", "8": " I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.'", "9": " It was at this time that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised in the Jordan by John.", "10": " And at once, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit, like a dove, descending on him.", "11": " And a voice came from heaven, 'You are my Son, the Beloved; my favour rests on you.'", "12": " And at once the Spirit drove him into the desert", "13": " and he remained there for forty days, and was put to the test by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels looked after him.", "14": " After John had been arrested, Jesus went into Galilee. There he proclaimed the gospel from God saying,", "15": " 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is close at hand. Repent, and believe the gospel.'", "16": " As he was walking along by the Lake of Galilee he saw Simon and Simon's brother Andrew casting a net in the lake -- for they were fishermen.", "17": " And Jesus said to them, 'Come after me and I will make you into fishers of people.'", "18": " And at once they left their nets and followed him.", "19": " Going on a little further, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they too were in their boat, mending the nets.", "20": " At once he called them and, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the men he employed, they went after him.", "21": " They went as far as Capernaum, and at once on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to teach.", "22": " And his teaching made a deep impression on them because, unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority.", "23": " And at once in their synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he shouted,", "24": " 'What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.'", "25": " But Jesus rebuked it saying, 'Be quiet! Come out of him!'", "26": " And the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and with a loud cry went out of him.", "27": " The people were so astonished that they started asking one another what it all meant, saying, 'Here is a teaching that is new, and with authority behind it: he gives orders even to unclean spirits and they obey him.'", "28": " And his reputation at once spread everywhere, through all the surrounding Galilean countryside.", "29": " And at once on leaving the synagogue, he went with James and John straight to the house of Simon and Andrew.", "30": " Now Simon's mother-in-law was in bed and feverish, and at once they told him about her.", "31": " He went in to her, took her by the hand and helped her up. And the fever left her and she began to serve them.", "32": " That evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by devils.", "33": " The whole town came crowding round the door,", "34": " and he cured many who were sick with diseases of one kind or another; he also drove out many devils, but he would not allow them to speak, because they knew who he was.", "35": " In the morning, long before dawn, he got up and left the house and went off to a lonely place and prayed there.", "36": " Simon and his companions set out in search of him,", "37": " and when they found him they said, 'Everybody is looking for you.'", "38": " He answered, 'Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns, so that I can proclaim the message there too, because that is why I came.'", "39": " And he went all through Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out devils.", "40": " A man suffering from a virulent skin-disease came to him and pleaded on his knees saying, 'If you are willing, you can cleanse me.'", "41": " Feeling sorry for him, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him and said to him, 'I am willing. Be cleansed.'", "42": " And at once the skin-disease left him and he was cleansed.", "43": " And at once Jesus sternly sent him away and said to him,", "44": " 'Mind you tell no one anything, but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offering for your cleansing prescribed by Moses as evidence to them.'", "45": " The man went away, but then started freely proclaiming and telling the story everywhere, so that Jesus could no longer go openly into any town, but stayed outside in deserted places. Even so, people from all around kept coming to him."},
{"1": " When he returned to Capernaum, some time later word went round that he was in the house;", "2": " and so many people collected that there was no room left, even in front of the door. He was preaching the word to them", "3": " when some people came bringing him a paralytic carried by four men,", "4": " but as they could not get the man to him through the crowd, they stripped the roof over the place where Jesus was; and when they had made an opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic lay.", "5": " Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, 'My child, your sins are forgiven.'", "6": " Now some scribes were sitting there, and they thought to themselves,", "7": " 'How can this man talk like that? He is being blasphemous. Who but God can forgive sins?'", "8": " And at once, Jesus, inwardly aware that this is what they were thinking, said to them, 'Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts?", "9": " Which of these is easier: to say to the paralytic, \"Your sins are forgiven\" or to say, \"Get up, pick up your stretcher and walk\"?", "10": " But to prove to you that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth' --", "11": " he said to the paralytic-'I order you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and go off home.'", "12": " And the man got up, and at once picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of everyone, so that they were all astonished and praised God saying, 'We have never seen anything like this.'", "13": " He went out again to the shore of the lake; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.", "14": " As he was walking along he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he got up and followed him.", "15": " When Jesus was at dinner in his house, a number of tax collectors and sinners were also sitting at table with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many of them among his followers.", "16": " When the scribes of the Pharisee party saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, 'Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?'", "17": " When Jesus heard this he said to them, 'It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but the sick. I came to call not the upright, but sinners.'", "18": " John's disciples and the Pharisees were keeping a fast, when some people came to him and said to him, 'Why is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?'", "19": " Jesus replied, 'Surely the bridegroom's attendants cannot fast while the bridegroom is still with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.", "20": " But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then, on that day, they will fast.", "21": " No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse.", "22": " And nobody puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins too. No! New wine into fresh skins!'", "23": " It happened that one Sabbath day he was taking a walk through the cornfields, and his disciples began to make a path by plucking ears of corn.", "24": " And the Pharisees said to him, 'Look, why are they doing something on the Sabbath day that is forbidden?'", "25": " And he replied, 'Have you never read what David did in his time of need when he and his followers were hungry-", "26": " how he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the loaves of the offering which only the priests are allowed to eat, and how he also gave some to the men with him?'", "27": " And he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath;", "28": " so the Son of man is master even of the Sabbath.'"},
{"1": " Another time he went into the synagogue, and there was a man present whose hand was withered.", "2": " And they were watching him to see if he would cure him on the Sabbath day, hoping for something to charge him with.", "3": " He said to the man with the withered hand, 'Get up and stand in the middle!'", "4": " Then he said to them, 'Is it permitted on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to kill?' But they said nothing.", "5": " Then he looked angrily round at them, grieved to find them so obstinate, and said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched it out and his hand was restored.", "6": " The Pharisees went out and began at once to plot with the Herodians against him, discussing how to destroy him.", "7": " Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, and great crowds from Galilee followed him. From Judaea,", "8": " and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and Transjordan and the region of Tyre and Sidon, great numbers who had heard of all he was doing came to him.", "9": " And he asked his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, to keep him from being crushed.", "10": " For he had cured so many that all who were afflicted in any way were crowding forward to touch him.", "11": " And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down before him and shout, 'You are the Son of God!'", "12": " But he warned them strongly not to make him known.", "13": " He now went up onto the mountain and summoned those he wanted. So they came to him", "14": " and he appointed twelve; they were to be his companions and to be sent out to proclaim the message,", "15": " with power to drive out devils.", "16": " And so he appointed the Twelve, Simon to whom he gave the name Peter,", "17": " James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges or 'Sons of Thunder';", "18": " Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot", "19": " and Judas Iscariot, the man who was to betray him.", "20": " He went home again, and once more such a crowd collected that they could not even have a meal.", "21": " When his relations heard of this, they set out to take charge of him; they said, 'He is out of his mind.'", "22": " The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, 'Beelzebul is in him,' and, 'It is through the prince of devils that he drives devils out.'", "23": " So he called them to him and spoke to them in parables,", "24": " 'How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot last.", "25": " And if a household is divided against itself, that household can never last.", "26": " Now if Satan has rebelled against himself and is divided, he cannot last either -- it is the end of him.", "27": " But no one can make his way into a strong man's house and plunder his property unless he has first tied up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house.", "28": " 'In truth I tell you, all human sins will be forgiven, and all the blasphemies ever uttered;", "29": " but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin.'", "30": " This was because they were saying, 'There is an unclean spirit in him.'", "31": " Now his mother and his brothers arrived and, standing outside, sent in a message asking for him.", "32": " A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him, 'Look, your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you.'", "33": " He replied, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?'", "34": " And looking at those sitting in a circle round him, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers.", "35": " Anyone who does the will of God, that person is my brother and sister and mother.'"},
{"1": " Again he began to teach them by the lakeside, but such a huge crowd gathered round him that he got into a boat on the water and sat there. The whole crowd were at the lakeside on land.", "2": " He taught them many things in parables, and in the course of his teaching he said to them,", "3": " 'Listen! Imagine a sower going out to sow.", "4": " Now it happened that, as he sowed, some of the seed fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate it up.", "5": " Some seed fell on rocky ground where it found little soil and at once sprang up, because there was no depth of earth;", "6": " and when the sun came up it was scorched and, not having any roots, it withered away.", "7": " Some seed fell into thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it produced no crop.", "8": " And some seeds fell into rich soil, grew tall and strong, and produced a good crop; the yield was thirty, sixty, even a hundredfold.'", "9": " And he said, 'Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!'", "10": " When he was alone, the Twelve, together with the others who formed his company, asked what the parables meant.", "11": " He told them, 'To you is granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything comes in parables,", "12": " so that they may look and look, but never perceive; listen and listen, but never understand; to avoid changing their ways and being healed.'", "13": " He said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables?", "14": " What the sower is sowing is the word.", "15": " Those on the edge of the path where the word is sown are people who have no sooner heard it than Satan at once comes and carries away the word that was sown in them.", "16": " Similarly, those who are sown on patches of rock are people who, when first they hear the word, welcome it at once with joy.", "17": " But they have no root deep down and do not last; should some trial come, or some persecution on account of the word, at once they fall away.", "18": " Then there are others who are sown in thorns. These have heard the word,", "19": " but the worries of the world, the lure of riches and all the other passions come in to choke the word, and so it produces nothing.", "20": " And there are those who have been sown in rich soil; they hear the word and accept it and yield a harvest, thirty and sixty and a hundredfold.'", "21": " He also said to them, 'Is a lamp brought in to be put under a tub or under the bed? Surely to be put on the lamp-stand?", "22": " For there is nothing hidden, but it must be disclosed, nothing kept secret except to be brought to light.", "23": " Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!'", "24": " He also said to them, 'Take notice of what you are hearing. The standard you use will be used for you -- and you will receive more besides;", "25": " anyone who has, will be given more; anyone who has not, will be deprived even of what he has.'", "26": " He also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the land.", "27": " Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake, the seed is sprouting and growing; how, he does not know.", "28": " Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.", "29": " And when the crop is ready, at once he starts to reap because the harvest has come.'", "30": " He also said, 'What can we say that the kingdom is like? What parable can we find for it?", "31": " It is like a mustard seed which, at the time of its sowing, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.", "32": " Yet once it is sown it grows into the biggest shrub of them all and puts out big branches so that the birds of the air can shelter in its shade.'", "33": " Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, so far as they were capable of understanding it.", "34": " He would not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples when they were by themselves.", "35": " With the coming of evening that same day, he said to them, 'Let us cross over to the other side.'", "36": " And leaving the crowd behind they took him, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.", "37": " Then it began to blow a great gale and the waves were breaking into the boat so that it was almost swamped.", "38": " But he was in the stern, his head on the cushion, asleep.", "39": " They woke him and said to him, 'Master, do you not care? We are lost!' And he woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Quiet now! Be calm!' And the wind dropped, and there followed a great calm.", "40": " Then he said to them, 'Why are you so frightened? Have you still no faith?'", "41": " They were overcome with awe and said to one another, 'Who can this be? Even the wind and the sea obey him.'"},
{"1": " They reached the territory of the Gerasenes on the other side of the lake,", "2": " and when he disembarked, a man with an unclean spirit at once came out from the tombs towards him.", "3": " The man lived in the tombs and no one could secure him any more, even with a chain,", "4": " because he had often been secured with fetters and chains but had snapped the chains and broken the fetters, and no one had the strength to control him.", "5": " All night and all day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he would howl and gash himself with stones.", "6": " Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up and fell at his feet", "7": " and shouted at the top of his voice, 'What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? In God's name do not torture me!'", "8": " For Jesus had been saying to him, 'Come out of the man, unclean spirit.'", "9": " Then he asked, 'What is your name?' He answered, 'My name is Legion, for there are many of us.'", "10": " And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the district.", "11": " Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding,", "12": " and the unclean spirits begged him, 'Send us to the pigs, let us go into them.'", "13": " So he gave them leave. With that, the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs charged down the cliff into the lake, and there they were drowned.", "14": " The men looking after them ran off and told their story in the city and in the country round about; and the people came to see what had really happened.", "15": " They came to Jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there -- the man who had had the legion in him -- properly dressed and in his full senses, and they were afraid.", "16": " And those who had witnessed it reported what had happened to the demoniac and what had become of the pigs.", "17": " Then they began to implore Jesus to leave their neighbourhood.", "18": " As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed begged to be allowed to stay with him.", "19": " Jesus would not let him but said to him, 'Go home to your people and tell them all that the Lord in his mercy has done for you.'", "20": " So the man went off and proceeded to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.", "21": " When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered round him and he stayed by the lake.", "22": " Then the president of the synagogue came up, named Jairus, and seeing him, fell at his feet", "23": " and begged him earnestly, saying, 'My little daughter is desperately sick. Do come and lay your hands on her that she may be saved and may live.'", "24": " Jesus went with him and a large crowd followed him; they were pressing all round him.", "25": " Now there was a woman who had suffered from a haemorrhage for twelve years;", "26": " after long and painful treatment under various doctors, she had spent all she had without being any the better for it; in fact, she was getting worse.", "27": " She had heard about Jesus, and she came up through the crowd and touched his cloak from behind, thinking,", "28": " 'If I can just touch his clothes, I shall be saved.'", "29": " And at once the source of the bleeding dried up, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her complaint.", "30": " And at once aware of the power that had gone out from him, Jesus turned round in the crowd and said, 'Who touched my clothes?'", "31": " His disciples said to him, 'You see how the crowd is pressing round you; how can you ask, \"Who touched me?\" '", "32": " But he continued to look all round to see who had done it.", "33": " Then the woman came forward, frightened and trembling because she knew what had happened to her, and she fell at his feet and told him the whole truth.", "34": " 'My daughter,' he said, 'your faith has restored you to health; go in peace and be free of your complaint.'", "35": " While he was still speaking some people arrived from the house of the president of the synagogue to say, 'Your daughter is dead; why put the Master to any further trouble?'", "36": " But Jesus overheard what they said and he said to the president of the synagogue, 'Do not be afraid; only have faith.'", "37": " And he allowed no one to go with him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.", "38": " So they came to the house of the president of the synagogue, and Jesus noticed all the commotion, with people weeping and wailing unrestrainedly.", "39": " He went in and said to them, 'Why all this commotion and crying? The child is not dead, but asleep.'", "40": " But they ridiculed him. So he turned them all out and, taking with him the child's father and mother and his own companions, he went into the place where the child lay.", "41": " And taking the child by the hand he said to her, 'Talitha kum!' which means, 'Little girl, I tell you to get up.'", "42": " The little girl got up at once and began to walk about, for she was twelve years old. At once they were overcome with astonishment,", "43": " and he gave them strict orders not to let anyone know about it, and told them to give her something to eat."},
{"1": " Leaving that district, he went to his home town, and his disciples accompanied him.", "2": " With the coming of the Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and most of them were astonished when they heard him. They said, 'Where did the man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been granted him, and these miracles that are worked through him?", "3": " This is the carpenter, surely, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joset and Jude and Simon? His sisters, too, are they not here with us?' And they would not accept him.", "4": " And Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is despised only in his own country, among his own relations and in his own house';", "5": " and he could work no miracle there, except that he cured a few sick people by laying his hands on them.", "6": " He was amazed at their lack of faith. He made a tour round the villages, teaching.", "7": " Then he summoned the Twelve and began to send them out in pairs, giving them authority over unclean spirits.", "8": " And he instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff -- no bread, no haversack, no coppers for their purses.", "9": " They were to wear sandals but, he added, 'Don't take a spare tunic.'", "10": " And he said to them, 'If you enter a house anywhere, stay there until you leave the district.", "11": " And if any place does not welcome you and people refuse to listen to you, as you walk away shake off the dust under your feet as evidence to them.'", "12": " So they set off to proclaim repentance;", "13": " and they cast out many devils, and anointed many sick people with oil and cured them.", "14": " King Herod had heard about him, since by now his name was well known.
