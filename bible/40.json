Who will mourn for her? Where would I find people to comfort you?", "8": " Are you better off than No-Amon situated among rivers, her defences the seas, her rampart the waters?", "9": " In Ethiopia and Egypt lay her strength, and it was boundless; Put and the Libyans served in her army.", "10": " But she too went into exile, into captivity; her little ones too were dashed to pieces at every crossroad; lots were drawn for her nobles, all her great men were put in chains.", "11": " You too will become drunk, you will go into hiding; you too will have to search for a refuge from the enemy.", "12": " Your fortifications are all fig trees, with early ripening figs: as soon as they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.", "13": " Look at your people: you are a nation of women!
