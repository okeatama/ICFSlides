{"1": " There was a man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the highlands of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.", "2": " He had two wives, one called Hannah, the other Peninnah; Peninnah had children but Hannah had none.", "3": " Every year this man used to go up from his town to worship, and to sacrifice to Yahweh Sabaoth at Shiloh. (The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there as priests of Yahweh.)", "4": " One day Elkanah offered a sacrifice. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;", "5": " to Hannah, however, he would give only one portion: for, although he loved Hannah more, Yahweh had made her barren.", "6": " Furthermore, her rival would taunt and provoke her, because Yahweh had made her womb barren.", "7": " And this went on year after year; every time they went up to the temple of Yahweh she used to taunt her. On that day she wept and would not eat anything;", "8": " so her husband Elkanah said, 'Hannah, why are you crying? Why are you not eating anything? Why are you so sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?'", "9": " When they had finished eating in the room, Hannah got up and stood before Yahweh. Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.", "10": " In the bitterness of her soul she prayed to Yahweh with many tears,", "11": " and she made this vow, 'Yahweh Sabaoth! Should you condescend to notice the humiliation of your servant and keep her in mind instead of disregarding your servant, and give her a boy, I will give him to Yahweh for the whole of his life and no razor shall ever touch his head.'", "12": " While she went on praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth,", "13": " for Hannah was speaking under her breath; her lips were moving but her voice could not be heard, and Eli thought that she was drunk.", "14": " Eli said, 'How much longer are you going to stay drunk? Get rid of your wine.'", "15": " 'No, my lord,' Hannah replied, 'I am a woman in great trouble; I have not been drinking wine or strong drink -- I am pouring out my soul before Yahweh.", "16": " Do not take your servant for a worthless woman; all this time I have been speaking from the depth of my grief and my resentment.'", "17": " Eli then replied, 'Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant what you have asked of him.'", "18": " To which she said, 'May your servant find favour in your sight.' With that, the woman went away; she began eating and was dejected no longer.", "19": " They got up early in the morning and, after worshipping Yahweh, set out and went home to Ramah. Elkanah lay with his wife Hannah, and Yahweh remembered her.", "20": " Hannah conceived and, in due course, gave birth to a son, whom she named Samuel, 'since', she said, 'I asked Yahweh for him.'", "21": " Elkanah, the husband, went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to fulfil his vow.", "22": " However, Hannah did not go up, having said to her husband, 'Not before the child has been weaned. Then I shall bring him and present him before Yahweh and he will stay there for ever.'", "23": " Elkanah her husband then said to her, 'Do what you think fit; wait until you have weaned him. May Yahweh bring about what he has said.' So the woman stayed behind and nursed her child until she weaned him.", "24": " When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, as well as a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and took him into the temple of Yahweh at Shiloh; the child was very young.", "25": " They sacrificed the bull and led the child to Eli.", "26": " She said, 'If you please, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to Yahweh.", "27": " This is the child for which I was praying, and Yahweh has granted me what I asked of him.", "28": " Now I make him over to Yahweh for the whole of his life. He is made over to Yahweh.' They then worshipped Yahweh there."},
{"1": " Hannah then prayed as follows: My heart exults in Yahweh, in my God is my strength lifted up, my mouth derides my foes, for I rejoice in your deliverance.", "2": " There is no Holy One like Yahweh, (indeed, there is none but you) no Rock like our God.", "3": " Do not keep talking so proudly, let no arrogance come from your mouth, for Yahweh is a wise God, his to weigh up deeds.", "4": " The bow of the mighty has been broken but those who were tottering are now braced with strength.", "5": " The full fed are hiring themselves out for bread but the hungry need labour no more; the barren woman bears sevenfold but the mother of many is left desolate.", "6": " Yahweh gives death and life, brings down to Sheol and draws up;", "7": " Yahweh makes poor and rich, he humbles and also exalts.", "8": " He raises the poor from the dust, he lifts the needy from the dunghill to give them a place with princes, to assign them a seat of honour; for to Yahweh belong the pillars of the earth, on these he has poised the world.", "9": " He safeguards the steps of his faithful but the wicked vanish in darkness (for human strength can win no victories).", "10": " Yahweh, his enemies are shattered, the Most High thunders in the heavens. Yahweh judges the ends of the earth, he endows his king with power, he raises up the strength of his Anointed.", "11": " Elkanah then went home to Ramah, but the child stayed in Yahweh's service, in the presence of Eli the priest.", "12": " Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they cared nothing for Yahweh", "13": " nor for what was due to the priests from the people. Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being cooked;", "14": " he would thrust this into cauldron or pan, or dish or pot, and the priest claimed for his own whatever the fork brought up. That was how they behaved with all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.", "15": " The priest's servant would even come up before the fat had been burnt and say to the person who was making the sacrifice, 'Give the priest some meat for him to roast. He will not accept boiled meat from you, only raw.'", "16": " Then, if the person replied, 'Let the fat be burnt first, and then take for yourself whatever you choose,' he would retort, 'No! You must give it to me now or I shall take it by force.'", "17": " The young men's sin was very great in Yahweh's eyes, because they treated with contempt the offering made to Yahweh.", "18": " Samuel was in Yahweh's service, a child wearing a linen loincloth.", "19": " His mother used to make him a little coat which she brought him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.", "20": " Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, 'May Yahweh grant you an heir by this woman in exchange for the one which she has made over to Yahweh,' and they would go home.", "21": " Yahweh visited Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the child Samuel grew up in Yahweh's presence.", "22": " Although very old, Eli heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel,", "23": " and said, 'Why are you behaving as all the people say you are?", "24": " No, my sons, what I hear reported by the people of Yahweh is not good.", "25": " If one person sins against another, God will be the arbiter, but if he sins against Yahweh, who will intercede for him?' But they did not listen to their father's words, for Yahweh was bent on killing them.", "26": " Meanwhile, the child Samuel went on growing in stature and in favour both with Yahweh and with people.", "27": " A man of God came to Eli and said to him, 'This is what Yahweh says, \"Did I not reveal myself to your father's family when they were in Egypt as slaves in Pharaoh's household?", "28": " Did I not single him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn the offering, to carry the ephod in my presence; and did I not grant all the burnt offerings made by the Israelites to your father's family?", "29": " Why do you trample on the offering and on the sacrifice which I have ordered for my Dwelling, and honour your sons more than me, by growing fat on the best of the offerings of Israel, my people?", "30": " Whereas -- this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, declares -- I had promised that your family and your father's family would walk in my presence for ever, now, however -- this is what Yahweh declares -- nothing of the sort! Those who honour me I honour in my turn, and those who despise me will be an object of contempt.", "31": " Be sure, the days are coming when I shall cut off your strength and the strength of your father's family, so that no one in your family will live to old age.", "32": " Beside the Dwelling, you will see all the benefits that I shall confer on Israel, but no one in your family will ever live to old age.", "33": " I shall keep one of you at my altar for his eyes to go blind and his soul to wither, but the bulk of your family will die by the sword.", "34": " ' \"What happens to your two sons Hophni and Phinehas will be a sign for you: on the same day both will die.", "35": " I shall raise myself a faithful priest, who will do as I intend and as I desire. I shall build him an enduring House and he will walk in the presence of my Anointed for ever.", "36": " The members of your House who survive will come and beg him on their knees for a silver coin and a loaf of bread and say: Please give me some priestly work, so that I can have a scrap of bread to eat.\" '"},
{"1": " Now, the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli; in those days it was rare for Yahweh to speak; visions were uncommon.", "2": " One day, it happened that Eli was lying down in his room. His eyes were beginning to grow dim; he could no longer see.", "3": " The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying in Yahweh's sanctuary, where the ark of God was,", "4": " when Yahweh called, 'Samuel! Samuel!' He answered, 'Here I am,'", "5": " and, running to Eli, he said, 'Here I am, as you called me.' Eli said, 'I did not call. Go back and lie down.' So he went and lay down.", "6": " And again Yahweh called, 'Samuel! Samuel!' He got up and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, as you called me.' He replied, 'I did not call, my son; go back and lie down.'", "7": " As yet, Samuel had no knowledge of Yahweh and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.", "8": " Again Yahweh called, the third time. He got up and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, as you called me.' Eli then understood that Yahweh was calling the child,", "9": " and he said to Samuel, 'Go and lie down, and if someone calls say, \"Speak, Yahweh; for your servant is listening.\" ' So Samuel went and lay down in his place.", "10": " Yahweh then came and stood by, calling as he had done before, 'Samuel! Samuel!' Samuel answered, 'Speak, Yahweh; for your servant is listening.'", "11": " Yahweh then said to Samuel, 'I am going to do something in Israel which will make the ears of all who hear of it ring.", "12": " I shall carry out that day against Eli everything that I have said about his family, from beginning to end.", "13": " You are to tell him that I condemn his family for ever, since he is aware that his sons have been cursing God and yet has not corrected them.", "14": " Therefore -- I swear it to the family of Eli -- no sacrifice or offering shall ever expiate the guilt of Eli's family.'", "15": " Samuel lay where he was until morning and then opened the doors of Yahweh's temple. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision,", "16": " but Eli called Samuel and said, 'Samuel, my son.' 'Here I am,' he replied.", "17": " Eli asked, 'What message did he give you? Please do not hide it from me. May God bring unnameable ills on you and worse ones, too, if you hide from me anything of what he said to you.'", "18": " Samuel then told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Eli said, 'He is Yahweh; let him do what he thinks good.'", "19": " Samuel grew up. Yahweh was with him and did not let a single word fall to the ground of all that he had told him.", "20": " All Israel knew, from Dan to Beersheba, that Samuel was attested as a prophet of Yahweh.", "21": " Yahweh continued to manifest himself at Shiloh, revealing himself to Samuel there,"},
{"1": " and, for all Israel, the word of Samuel was as the word of Yahweh; since Eli was very old and his sons persisted in their wicked behaviour towards Yahweh. It happened at that time that the Philistines mustered to make war on Israel and Israel went out to meet them in war, pitching camp near Ebenezer while the Philistines pitched camp at Aphek. ", "2": " The Philistines drew up their battle-line against Israel, the fighting was fierce, and Israel was beaten by the Philistines: about four thousand men in their ranks were killed on the field of battle.", "3": " When the troops returned to camp, the elders of Israel said, 'Why has Yahweh caused us to be beaten by the Philistines today? Let us fetch the ark of our God from Shiloh so that, when it goes with us, it may save us from the clutches of our enemies.'", "4": " So the troops sent to Shiloh and brought away the ark of Yahweh Sabaoth enthroned on the winged creatures; the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, came with the ark.", "5": " When the ark of Yahweh arrived in the camp, all Israel raised a great war cry so that the earth resounded.", "6": " When the Philistines heard the noise of the war cry, they said, 'What can this great war cry in the Hebrew camp mean?' And they realised that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp.", "7": " At this, the Philistines were afraid; for they said, 'God has come into the camp. Disaster!' they said. 'For nothing like this has ever happened before.", "8": " Disaster! Who will rescue us from the clutches of this mighty God? This was the God who struck down Egypt with every kind of misfortune in the desert.", "9": " But take courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been slaves to you. Be men and fight.'", "10": " So the Philistines gave battle and Israel was defeated, each man fleeing to his tent. The slaughter was very great: on the Israelite side, thirty thousand foot soldiers fell.", "11": " The ark of God was captured too, and Hophni and Phinehas the two sons of Eli died.", "12": " A Benjaminite ran from the battle-line and reached Shiloh the same day, his clothes torn and dust on his head.", "13": " When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. The man came into the town and told the news, whereupon cries of anguish filled the town.", "14": " Eli heard the sound and asked, 'What does this uproar mean?' The man hurried on and told Eli.", "15": " Eli was ninety-eight years old; his gaze was fixed; he was blind.", "16": " The man said to Eli, 'I have come from the camp. I escaped from the battle-line today.' 'My son,' said Eli, 'what happened?'", "17": " The messenger replied, 'Israel has fled before the Philistines; the army has been utterly routed. What is worse, your two sons are dead and the ark of God has been captured.'", "18": " When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backwards off his seat by the gate and broke his neck and died, for he was old and heavy. He had been judge of Israel for forty years.", "19": " Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near her time. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead she crouched down and gave birth, for her labour pains had come on.", "20": " When she was at the point of death, the women at her side said, 'Do not be afraid; you have given birth to a son.' But she did not answer and took no notice.", "21": " She named the child Ichabod, saying, 'The glory has gone from Israel,' alluding to the capture of the ark of God and to her father-in-law and husband.", "22": " She said, 'The glory has gone from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured.'"},
{"1": " When the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.", "2": " Taking the ark of God, the Philistines put it in the temple of Dagon, setting it down beside Dagon.", "3": " When the people of Ashdod got up the following morning and went to the temple of Dagon, there lay Dagon face down on the ground before the ark of Yahweh. They picked Dagon up and put him back in his place.", "4": " But when they got up on the following morning, there lay Dagon face down on the ground before the ark of Yahweh, and Dagon's head and two hands lay severed on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left in its place.", "5": " This is why the priests of Dagon and the people frequenting Dagon's temple never step on Dagon's threshold in Ashdod, even today.", "6": " Yahweh oppressed the people of Ashdod; he ravaged them and afflicted them with tumours -- Ashdod and its territory. When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening they said,", "7": " 'The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, for he is oppressing us and our god Dagon.'", "8": " So they summoned all the Philistine chiefs to them, and said, 'What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?' They decided, 'The ark of the God of Israel shall be taken away to Gath.' So they took the ark of the God of Israel to Gath.", "9": " But after they had taken it there, Yahweh oppressed that town and a great panic broke out; afflicting the people of the town from highest to lowest, he brought them out in tumours too.", "10": " They then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it came to Ekron the Ekronites shouted, 'They have brought me the ark of the God of Israel to kill me and my people!'", "11": " They summoned all the Philistine chiefs and said, 'Send the ark of the God of Israel away; let it go back to where it belongs and not kill me and my people' -- for there was mortal panic throughout the town; God was oppressing them.", "12": " The people who did not die were afflicted with tumours, and the wailing from the town rose to the sky."},
{"1": " The ark of Yahweh was in Philistine territory for seven months.", "2": " The Philistines then called for their priests and diviners and asked, 'What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh? Tell us how to send it back to where it belongs.'", "3": " They replied, 'If you send the ark of the God of Israel away, you must certainly not send it away without a gift; you must pay him a guilt offering. You will then recover and will realise why he continually oppressed you.'", "4": " They then asked, 'What guilt offering ought we to pay him?' They replied, 'Corresponding to the number of Philistine chiefs: five golden tumours and five golden rats, since the same plague afflicted your chiefs as the rest of you.", "5": " So make models of your tumours and models of your rats ravaging the territory, and pay honour to the God of Israel. Then perhaps he will stop oppressing you, your gods and your country.", "6": " Why should you be as stubborn as Egypt and Pharaoh were? After he had brought disasters on them, did they not let the people leave?", "7": " Now, then, take and fit out a new cart, and two milch cows that have never borne the yoke. Then harness the cows to the cart and take their calves back to the byre.", "8": " Then take the ark of Yahweh, place it on the cart, and put the golden objects which you are paying him as guilt offering in a box beside it; and then send it off on its own.", "9": " Watch it; if it goes up the road to its own territory, towards Beth-Shemesh, then he was responsible for this great harm to us; but if not, we shall know that it was not his hand that struck us, and that this has happened to us by chance.'", "10": " The people did this. They took two milch cows and harnessed them to the cart, shutting their calves in the byre.", "11": " They then put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, with the box and the golden rats and the models of their tumours.", "12": " The cows made straight for Beth-Shemesh, keeping to the one road, lowing as they went and turning neither to right nor to left. The Philistine chiefs followed them as far as the boundaries of Beth-Shemesh.", "13": " The people of Beth-Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the plain when they looked up and saw the ark and went joyfully to meet it.", "14": " When the cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-Shemesh, it stopped. There was a large stone there, and they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.", "15": " The Levites had taken down the ark of Yahweh and the box with it containing the golden objects and put these on the large stone. That day the people of Beth-Shemesh presented burnt offerings and made sacrifices to Yahweh.", "16": " The five chiefs of the Philistines, having witnessed this, went back to Ekron the same day.", "17": " The golden tumours paid by the Philistines as a guilt offering to Yahweh were as follows: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;", "18": " and golden rats to the number of all the Philistine towns, those of the five chiefs, from fortified towns down to open villages: still to this day the large stone in the field of Joshua of Beth-Shemesh, on which they put the ark of Yahweh, is a witness.", "19": " Of the people of Beth-Shemesh the sons of Jeconiah had not rejoiced when they saw the ark of Yahweh, and Yahweh struck down seventy of them. The people mourned because Yahweh had struck them so fiercely.", "20": " The people of Beth-Shemesh then said, 'Who can stand his ground before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall he go, so that we are rid of him?'", "21": " So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-Jearim, to say, 'The Philistines have sent back the ark of Yahweh; come down and take it up to your town.'"},
{"1": " The men of Kiriath-Jearim came and, taking up the ark of Yahweh, brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of Yahweh.", "2": " From the day when the ark was installed at Kiriath-Jearim, a long time went by -- twenty years -- and the whole House of Israel longed for Yahweh.", "3": " Samuel then spoke as follows to the whole House of Israel, 'If you are returning to Yahweh with all your heart, banish the foreign gods and Astartes which you now have, and set your heart on Yahweh and serve him alone; and he will deliver you from the power of the Philistines.'", "4": " And the Israelites banished the Baals and Astartes and served Yahweh alone.", "5": " Samuel then said, 'Muster all Israel at Mizpah and I shall plead with Yahweh for you.'", "6": " So they mustered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. They fasted that day and declared, 'We have sinned against Yahweh.' And Samuel was judge over the Israelites at Mizpah.", "7": " When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had mustered at Mizpah, the Philistine chiefs marched on Israel; and when the Israelites heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.", "8": " They said to Samuel, 'Do not stop calling on Yahweh our God to rescue us from the power of the Philistines.'", "9": " Samuel took a sucking lamb and presented it as a burnt offering to Yahweh, and he called on Yahweh on behalf of Israel and Yahweh heard him.", "10": " While Samuel was in the act of presenting burnt offering, the Philistines joined battle with Israel, but that day Yahweh thundered violently over the Philistines, threw them into panic and Israel defeated them.", "11": " The men of Israel sallied out from Mizpah in pursuit of the Philistines and beat them all the way to below Beth-Car.", "12": " Samuel then took a stone and erected it between Mizpah and the Tooth, and gave it the name Ebenezer, saying, 'Yahweh helped us as far as this.'", "13": " So the Philistines were humbled and no longer came into Israelite territory; Yahweh oppressed the Philistines throughout the life of Samuel.", "14": " The towns which the Philistines had taken from Israel were given back to Israel, from Ekron all the way to Gath, and Israel freed their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace, too, between Israel and the Amorites.", "15": " Samuel was judge over Israel throughout his life.", "16": " Each year he went on circuit through Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all these places.", "17": " He would then return to Ramah, since his home was there; there too he judged Israel. And there he built an altar to Yahweh."},
{"1": " When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges of Israel.", "2": " His eldest son was called Joel and his second one, Abijah; they were judges at Beersheba.", "3": " His sons did not follow his example but, seduced by the love of money, took bribes and gave biased verdicts.", "4": " The elders of Israel all assembled, went back to Samuel at Ramah, and said,", "5": " 'Look, you are old, and your sons are not following your example. So give us a king to judge us, like the other nations.'", "6": " Samuel thought that it was wrong of them to say, 'Let us have a king to judge us,' so he prayed to Yahweh.", "7": " But Yahweh said to Samuel, 'Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you: it is not you they have rejected", "8": " but me, not wishing me to reign over them any more. They are now doing to you exactly what they have done to me since the day I brought them out of Egypt until now, deserting me and serving other gods.", "9": " So, do what they ask; only, you must give them a solemn warning, and must tell them what the king who is to reign over them will do.'", "10": " Everything that Yahweh had said, Samuel then repeated to the people who were asking him for a king.", "11": " He said, 'This is what the king who is to reign over you will do. He will take your sons and direct them to his chariotry and cavalry, and they will run in front of his chariot.", "12": " He will use them as leaders of a thousand and leaders of fifty; he will make them plough his fields and gather in his harvest and make his weapons of war and the gear for his chariots.", "13": " He will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks and bakers.", "14": " He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his officials.", "15": " He will tithe your crops and vineyards to provide for his courtiers and his officials.", "16": " He will take the best of your servants, men and women, of your oxen and your donkeys, and make them work for him.", "17": " He will tithe your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.", "18": " When that day comes, you will cry aloud because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but on that day Yahweh will not hear you.'", "19": " The people, however, refused to listen to Samuel. They said, 'No! We are determined to have a king,", "20": " so that we can be like the other nations, with our own king to rule us and lead us and fight our battles.'", "21": " Samuel listened to all that the people had to say and repeated it in Yahweh's ear.", "22": " Yahweh then said to Samuel, 'Do as they ask and give them a king.' Samuel then said to the Israelites, 'Go home, each of you, to his own town.'"},
{"1": " Among the men of Benjamin was a man called Kish son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah; a Benjaminite and a person of rank.", "2": " He had a son called Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Of all the Israelites there was no one more handsome than he; he stood head and shoulders taller than anyone else.", "3": " Now since the donkeys belonging to Kish, Saul's father, had strayed, Kish said to his son Saul, 'My son, take one of the servants with you and be off; go and look for the donkeys.'", "4": " They went through the highlands of Ephraim, they went through the territory of Shalishah, and did not find them; they went through the territory of Shaalim but they were not there; they went through the territory of Benjamin and did not find them.", "5": " When they reached the territory of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, 'Come on, let us go back or my father will stop worrying over the donkeys and start being anxious about us.'", "6": " The servant, however, replied, 'Look, there is a man of God in this town, a man who is held in honour; everything he says comes true. Let us go there, then; perhaps he will be able to show us the way that we should take.'", "7": " Saul said to his servant, 'But if we do go, what can we take to the man? The food in our sacks is finished, and we have no present to offer the man of God. What else have we got?'", "8": " The servant spoke up again and said to Saul, 'Look, I happen to have a quarter of a silver shekel; I shall give that to the man of God, for him to tell us which way to go.'", "9": " In Israel, in olden days, when anyone used to go to consult God, he would say, 'Come on, let us go to the seer,' for a man who is now called a 'prophet' used to be called a 'seer' in olden days.", "10": " Saul then said to his servant, 'Well said! Come on, let us go.' And they went off to the town where the man of God was.", "11": " As they were going up the slope to the town they came across some girls going out to draw water, and said to them, 'Is the seer there?'", "12": " The girls replied, 'He is. He arrived a moment or two ahead of you. You had better hurry: he has just come to town because the people are having a sacrifice today on the high place.", "13": " You can catch him as soon as you go into the town, before he goes up to the high place for the meal. The people will not eat until he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests will start eating. If you go up now, you will find him straight away.'", "14": " So they went up to the town and, as they were going through the gate, Samuel came out towards them on his way to the high place.", "15": " Now, Yahweh had given Samuel a revelation the day before Saul came, saying,", "16": " 'About this time tomorrow, I shall send you a man from the territory of Benjamin; you are to anoint him as prince of my people Israel, and he will save my people from the power of the Philistines; for I have seen the misery of my people and their cries of anguish have come to me.'", "17": " When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh told him, 'That is the man of whom I said to you, \"He is to govern my people.\" '", "18": " Saul accosted Samuel in the gateway and said, 'Tell me, please, where the seer's house is.'", "19": " Samuel replied to Saul, 'I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place. You must eat with me today. Tomorrow, when I let you go, I shall tell you whatever is on your mind.", "20": " As regards your donkeys, however, which strayed three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And for whom is the whole wealth of Israel destined, if not for you and for all the members of your father's family?'", "21": " To this, Saul replied, 'Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?

What crime have I committed?", "19": " May my lord king now listen to his servant's words: if Yahweh has incited you against me, may he be appeased with an offering; but if human beings have done it, may they be accursed before Yahweh, since they have as effectively banished me today from sharing in Yahweh's heritage as if they had said, \"Go and serve other gods!\"", "20": " So I pray now that my blood shall not be shed on soil remote from Yahweh's presence, when the king of Israel has mounted an expedition to take my life, as one might hunt a partridge in the mountains!'", "21": " Saul replied, 'I have done wrong!

Achish replied to David, 'Right, I shall appoint you as my permanent bodyguard.'", "3": " Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned him and buried him at Ramah, his own town. Saul had expelled the necromancers and wizards from the country.", "4": " Meanwhile the Philistines had mustered and had come and pitched camp at Shunem. Saul mustered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.", "5": " When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and his heart trembled violently.", "6": " Saul consulted Yahweh, but Yahweh gave him no answer, either by dream, divination or prophet.", "7": " Saul then said to his servants, 'Find a necromancer for me, so that I can go and consult her.' His servants replied, 'There is a necromancer at En-Dor.'", "8": " And so Saul, disguising himself and changing his clothes, set out accompanied by two men; their visit to the woman took place at night. 'Disclose the future to me', he said, 'by means of a ghost. Conjure up the one I shall name to you.'", "9": " The woman replied, 'Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has outlawed necromancers and wizards from the country; why are you setting a trap for my life, then, to have me killed?'", "10": " But Saul swore to her by Yahweh, 'As Yahweh lives,' he said, 'no blame shall attach to you for this business.'", "11": " The woman asked, 'Whom shall I conjure up for you?' He replied, 'Conjure up Samuel.'", "12": " The woman then saw Samuel and, giving a great cry, she said to Saul, 'Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!'", "13": " The king said, 'Do not be afraid! What do you see?' The woman replied to Saul, 'I see a ghost rising from the earth.'", "14": " 'What is he like?' he asked. She replied, 'It is an old man coming up; he is wrapped in a cloak.' Saul then knew that it was Samuel and, bowing to the ground, prostrated himself.", "15": " Samuel said to Saul, 'Why have you disturbed my rest by conjuring me up?' Saul replied, 'I am in great distress; the Philistines are waging war on me, and God has abandoned me and no longer answers me either by prophet or by dream; and so I have summoned you to tell me what I ought to do.' ", "16": " Samuel said, 'Why consult me, when Yahweh has abandoned you and has become your enemy?", "17": " Yahweh has treated you as he foretold through me; he has snatched the sovereignty from your hand and given it to your neighbour, David,", "18": " because you disobeyed Yahweh's voice and did not execute his fierce anger against Amalek.

Let me offer you a piece of bread. Eat something and get some strength for your journey.'", "23": " But he refused. 'I will not eat,' he said. His servants however pressed him, and so did the woman.

{"1": " The Philistines mustered all their forces at Aphek while the Israelites pitched camp near the spring in Jezreel.", "2": " The Philistine commanders marched past with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his men brought up the rear with Achish.", "3": " The Philistine chiefs asked, 'What are these Hebrews doing?' Achish replied to them, 'Why, this is David the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me for the last year or two. I have had no fault to find with him from the day he gave himself up to me until the present time.' ", "4": " But the Philistine chiefs were angry with him. 'Send the man back,' they said, 'make him go back to the place which you assigned to him. He cannot go into battle with us, in case he turns on us once battle is joined. Would there be a better way for the man to regain his master's favour than with the heads of these men here?", "5": " Is not this the David of whom they sang as they danced: Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?", "6": " So Achish called David and said, 'As Yahweh lives, you are loyal, and I am quite content with all your doings in our campaigning together, since I have found no fault with you from the day you came to me until the present time. But you are not acceptable to the chiefs.

Do not harbour resentment, since personally I have no fault to find with you.
